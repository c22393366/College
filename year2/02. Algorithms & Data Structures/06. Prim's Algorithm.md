# <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Prim's MST Algorithm:</mark>

- In computer science, Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted undirected graph. 

- This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. 

- The algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník and later independently by computer scientist Robert C. Prim in 1957 and rediscovered by Edsger Dijkstra in 1959. Therefore it is also sometimes called the DJP algorithm, the Jarník algorithm, or the Prim–Jarník algorithm.

- The algorithm continuously increases the size of a tree, one edge at a time, starting with a tree consisting of a single vertex, until it spans all vertices.

	- <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Initialise:</mark> V<sub>new</sub> = {x}, where x is an arbitrary node (starting point) from V, E<sub>new</sub> = {}
	- <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Repeat</mark> until V<sub>new</sub> = V:
	- Choose an edge (u, v) with minimal weight such that u is in V<sub>new</sub> and v is not (if there are multiple edges with the same weight, any of them may be picked)
	- Add v to V<sub>new</sub>, and (u, v) to E<sub>new</sub>
	- <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Output:</mark> V<sub>new</sub> and E<sub>new</sub> describe a minimal spanning tree

Validity of this algorithm is based on the property (which can be proved):

 <mark style="background: #BD6500;">MST Property:</mark>

- Given any division of the vertices of a graph into two sets, the shortest edge which connects a vertex in one of the sets to a vertex in the other set is part of a MST.

### <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Data Structures Required for Adjacency Lists representation
</mark>

- a Java/C#/C++ class called ``GraphLists`` to encapsulate most of the data structures and methods
- a Node structure for lined lists. Use these to store graph edges in the linked lists
- array of linked lists to store the graph in memory. Declared with 
```Java
Node[] adj; 
(Node ** adj; //in C++)
```
- an int array ``dist[ ]`` to record the current distance of a vertex from the MST.
- an int array ``parent[ ]`` to store the MST
- a heap h to find the next vertex nearest the MST so that it can be added to the MST. The heap minimises the number of steps in finding the next nearest vertex. log V steps instead of V steps in sequential search.
- an int array ``hPos[ ]`` which records the position of any vertex with the heap array ``a[ ]``. So vertex v is in position ``hPos[v]`` in ``a[]``.

```Java
Prim_Lists( Vertex s )
Begin
	// G = (V, E)
	foreach v ∈ V
		dist[v] := ∞
		parent[v] := 0 // treat 0 as a special null vertex
		hPos[v] := 0 // indicates that v  heap
	h = new Heap(|V|, hPos, dist) // priority queue (heap) initially empty
	h.insert(s) // s will be the root of the MST
	while (not h.isEmpty() ) // should repeat |V|-1 times
		v := h.remove() // add v to the MST
		dist[v] := -dist[v] // marks v as now in the MST
		foreach u  adj(v) // examine each neighbour u of v
			if wgt(v, u) < dist[u]
				dist[u] := wgt(v, u)
				parent[u] := v
				if u ∉ h
					h.insert( u)
				else
					h.siftUp( hPos[u])
			end if
		end for
	end while
	return parent
End
```

### <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Implementation Comments:</mark>

- First of all, a simple way to represent the vertices is to number them as 1, 2, 3 ... |V|.
- The most efficient way to represent the graph is to use and adjacency list, especially for sparse graphs. This is an array of linked lists. For dense ones an adjacency matrix would be fine.
- Also, a number of other data structures are used here
- The distance from a vertex u, outside of the current spanning tree, to some nearest vertex in the tree can be implemented as an array ``dist[u]``. Initially all nodes are assumed to be an infinite distance away, ∞ (or INT_MAX in C++ or int.MaxValue in C# ).
- An array ``parent[u]`` keeps track of the parent vertex of u in the MST as it grows. In fact parent[ ] stores the MST.
- The heap vertex with the highest priority is the one closest to the MST being built, i.e. the vertex u where ``dist[u]`` is a minimum. This suggests a priority queue or heap to store vertices which are outside the current MST and are being considered for inclusion.
- When vertex u is stored on the heap, only the number that represents it is stored on the heap. Its priority is stored separately This cannot be used for positioning it within the heap. Instead use ``dist[u]`` to store its priority.
- Nodes will be positioned within the heap according to their distance from the MSP being built. So the heap data structure will need a pointer to ``dist[ ]``. Then instead of have something like ``v > a[k/2]``, one would have ``dist[v] < dist[a[k/2]]``.
- If a is the heap array, then ``a[i]`` given the vertex at position i in the heap, i.e. ``a[]`` maps from a heap position or index to a vertex.
- When ``siftUp()`` is performed on a node u in the heap, its position in the heap will be required.
- We need to map from a vertex to a heap position, which is the opposite of what a[] does. Use a<sup>-1</sup> for this. Both a and a<sup>-1</sup> are be implemented as arrays. Call a<sup>-1</sup>() hPos[] if you want.

```
a : Index -> Vertex
hPos : Vertex -> Index
```

- ``siftUp()`` and ``siftDown()`` should take are of adjusting ``hPos[]``;
- On finding a shorter edge connecting a vertex u to the MST being built, its priority within the heap increases and so ``siftUp()`` would be called as in:
- ``siftUp( hPos [u])``
- The heap will need to update both ``a[]`` and ``hPos[]`` and will need access to ``dist[]``.
- A good way to give the heap access to the ``dist[]`` and ``hPos[]`` arrays is to pass them as parameter arguments to the heap constructor.
- In the main method could have
```Java
Graph g = new Graph(fileName);
mst = g.Prim( 3);
```

```Java

Prim_Matrix ( Vertex s )
	// G = (V, E)
	foreach v ∈ V
		dist[v] := ∞
		parent[v] := null
	v := s // s will be the root of the MSP
	dist[null] := ∞
	
	while v != null // should repeat |V|-1 times 
		dist[v] := -dist[v] // marks v as now in the MST
		min := null
		
		foreach u from 1 to |V| // examine matrix row
			if u  adj(v)  wgt(v, u) < dist[u]
				dist[u] := wgt(v, u)
				parent[u] := v
			
			if dist[u] < dist[min] ^ dist(u) > 0
				min := u
			
			v := min

### <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Time Complexity Analysis:</mark>

- Time Complexity Analysis Adjacency Lists Graph with Heap
- Heap contains up to V vertices. So a heap operation requires a maximum of log<sub>2</sub>*V* steps.
- Initialisation <mark style="background: #BD6500;">for loop</mark> – requires V steps

<mark style="background: #BD6500;">while loop</mark>
- each vertex is removed from heap once – so requires at most *V*log<sub>2</sub>*V* steps
- foreach loop within the while loop causes all the linked list nodes of the graph representation to be iterated thru once and since each list node represents an edge, the total number of iterations is E
- so each edge is examined once and may involve an ``insert()`` or a ``siftUp()`` . In total this means at most *E*log<sub>2</sub>*V* steps.
- Therefore complexity = O(*V* + *V* log<sub>2</sub>*V* + *E*log<sub>2</sub>*V*) ≈ O(*E*log<sub>2</sub>*V*)
- For a <mark style="background: #BD6500;">sparse</mark> graph <mark style="background: #BD6500;">E ≈ kV</mark> (k some constant), so complexity ≈ O(*E*log<sub>2</sub>V) = O(*V*log<sub>2</sub>*V*)
- For a <mark style="background: #BD6500;">dense</mark> graph <mark style="background: #BD6500;">E ≈ V<sup>2</sup></mark>, so complexity ≈ O(*E*log<sub>2</sub>V) = O(*V*<sup>2</sup>log<sub>2</sub>*V*)

### <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Adjacency Matrix Graph:</mark>

In this representation no heap is used and the while loop + for loop combination iterates through the whole matrix, i.e. V<sup>2</sup> steps. So for both sparse and dense graphs in matrix representation:

Complexity = O(V<sup>2</sup>)

| Minimum edge weight data structure                                     | Time complexity (total) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| adjacency matrix for dense or sparse graph                             | O(V<sup>2</sup>)        |
| binary heap and adjacency lists for sparse<br>graph                    | O(V log V)              |
| binary heap and adjacency lists for dense<br>graph (E ≈ V<sup>2</sup>) | O(V<sup>2</sup> log V)  |
| Fibonacci heap and adjacency list                                      | O( E + V log V )        |

Since V<sup>2</sup> >> V log<sub>2</sub>V as V get larger, one would expect adjacency list performance to be much faster on sparse graphs.

Furthermore, adjacency lists use only the required memory for sparse graphs and are more efficient space-wise for sparse graphs. Matrix representation is very inefficient both memory wise and in performance for sparse graphs.

Better to use an adjacency matrix for a dense graph, in which case which gives complexity O(V<sup>2</sup>) and adjacency lists for sparse graphs  O(V<sub>2</sub> log V)
