# <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms</mark>

- Three well known algorithms, of which we will consider the first two are are due to:
	- Prim
	- Kruskal
	- Bor≈Øvka
	
- Given a connected, weighted and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. 

- A single graph can have many different spanning trees. 

- The weight of a spanning tree is obtained by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree. 

- A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.

- One example would be a cable TV company laying cable to a new neighbourhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths, then there would be a graph representing which points are connected by those paths.

- Some of those paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. 

- A spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects to every house. 

- There might be several spanning trees possible. A minimum spanning tree would be one with the lowest total cost.

- This figure shows there may be more than one minimum spanning tree in a graph. In the figure, the two trees below the graph are two possibilities of minimum spanning tree of the given graph.
