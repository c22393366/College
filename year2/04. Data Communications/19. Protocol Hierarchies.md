#DataComms 

Computer networks are generally comprised of numerous pieces of hardware and software

Recall the previous attempt to "model" how these components interconnect and interact with each other

Whilst this horizontal model is useful when looking at hardware components, the reality is that it does not explain everything.

From previous discussions on: <mark style="background: #69E772;">Data Link Control, LANs technologies, Internetworking </mark> etc. much of the functionality required to provide communications between host machines is not necessarily provided on a single hardware component as suggested by the previous slide

The purpose of each layer is to provide <mark style="background: #69E772;">one</mark> component of  the overall solution to the <mark style="background: #69E772;">“Communications Problem”</mark> such  as “frame reception/transmission” etc.

These layers of software can exist on: separate hardware components and/or hosts or, in some instances multiple layers can exist on a single hardware component and/or hosts

This concept is not dissimilar to the approach used  for software development:
* Objects or libraries are used to perform specific operations.
* Importantly the object/library function keeps details of its internal state and algorithms hidden from the main program.
 
The same approach is used for network protocol software:
* Each layer of software provides one part of the solution such  as: frame transmission/reception or, transmitting one/zeros  onto a wire/wireless transmission medium etc.
	
With networking software, the layers of protocol  software are organised into a Stack:
* Each layer sits between other layers as shown in the next slide.
* Each layer is said to offer services to higher layers and to use the services offered by the lower layers.

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol Hierarchies - Terminology:</mark>
	
<mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol/Protocol Entity:</mark> A software module that performs one sub-task such as: frame transmission/reception etc.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol suites/stack:</mark> A number of such software modules that work together to perform all of the tasks required to enable two hosts communicate.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol Architectures/Model:</mark> A model by which we can categorise or view the different protocol layers.

The following slide provides an analogy to the Communications Problem:
* How can two CEOs communicate with each other effectively and efficiently?

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">The OSI ISO Reference (7 layer model):</mark>
	
Communications between computer hosts presents the same challenges.

The OSI model deals with connecting <mark style="background: #69E772;">open</mark> systems: i.e. systems that are <mark style="background: #69E772;">open</mark> for communication with <mark style="background: #69E772;">other</mark> systems  regardless of who built them or how they were manufactured.

The principles that were applied to arrive at the seven layers are as follows: 
* Each layer was created when a different <mark style="background: #69E772;">level of abstraction</mark> was required.
* Each layer performs one well-defined function with each function chosen carefully to facilitate the development of <mark style="background: #69E772;">standardised protocols</mark>.
* The number of layers chosen was sufficient enough to ensure that distinct functions were not <mark style="background: #69E772;">lumped</mark> together to become unwieldy.

The layers of software work together in unison to provide overall solutions to the problems of communicating between host computers across complex networks.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Information</mark> flows across each of the interfaces (boundaries) between the layers:
* These boundaries were carefully defined to <mark style="background: #69E772;">minimise</mark> information flow across the interfaces.
* The following slides discuss the functionality of each layer of protocol software. This functionality should be recognisable from previous discussions.

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">The 7 layer Model: Layer-by-layer:</mark>
	
<mark style="background: #69E772;">The Physical Layer (Layer 1):</mark> 
* Concerned with  transmitting <mark style="background: #69E772;">raw</mark> bits over a <mark style="background: #69E772;">communication channel</mark>:
* Its purpose is to ensure that the transmission of binary 1s and 0s adheres to what is appropriate for the transmission medium and what is expected by the <mark style="background: #69E772;">receiver</mark>.

* Primarily it deals with matters such as: What voltage levels are used? What frequencies are used? How long does it take to transmit a bit (Bit Duration)? etc. 

* There are certain design issues to address such as: the <mark style="background: #69E772;">mechanical</mark> and <mark style="background: #69E772;">electrical</mark> design of the plugs and sockets, <mark style="background: #69E772;">timing interfaces</mark>, the physical <mark style="background: #69E772;">transmission medium</mark> etc
	
<mark style="background: #69E772;">The Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</mark>

* Concerned with the successful transmission of data across an individual link.
* Its purpose is to transforms a <mark style="background: #69E772;">raw</mark> transmission facility into a <mark style="background: #69E772;">data communications channel</mark> that <mark style="background: #69E772;">appears</mark> free of transmission errors.
* Primarily it deals with matters such as the transmission/reception of <mark style="background: #69E772;">data frames</mark>. 
* There are certain design issues to address such as: the creation of localised unique addressing, the creation of a unique framing structure, flow control, error control, controlling access to a <mark style="background: #69E772;">shared</mark> channel etc.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">The Network Layer (Layer 3):</mark>
	
* Concerned with the successful delivery of data between hosts across complex network infrastructures:
* Its purpose is to control the operation of the <mark style="background: #69E772;">sub-networks</mark> to achieve host-to-host delivery.
* Primarily it deals with matters such as the routing of <mark style="background: #69E772;">packets</mark> from the <mark style="background: #69E772;">source</mark> station towards the <mark style="background: #69E772;">destination</mark> station across sub-nets etc. 
* There are certain design issues to address such as: the creation a globally unique address space, the creation of a globally unique framing structure.
* Essentially this layer is responsible for managing data communications across interconnected <mark style="background: #69E772;">heterogeneous</mark> networks.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">The Transport Layer (Layer 4):</mark>
*  This is a key layer. 
* It is a true <mark style="background: #69E772;">end-to-end</mark> layer responsible for the reliable delivery of data between <mark style="background: #69E772;">processes</mark> on end-host machines i.e. process-to-process delivery:
* Its purpose is to provide a reliable data transport service to applications.
* Primarily it deals with interfacing with applications for the purpose of exchanging data between applications across a network.
* There are certain design issues to address such as: multiplexing data streams from/to remote applications, data loss, network latency etc.
	
### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Data Flows:</mark>

The layers work together to provide the complete functionality required to facilitate communications between two remotely connected host machines regardless of how they connect to the internet.

The following slide shows how data flows between the layers (up-and-down):

Note that sometimes it is necessary to break up the data to meet some size restrictions associated with some lower layer protocol software. Recall use of <mark style="background: #69E772;">Fragmentation</mark> at the Network layer.

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Data Flows:</mark>

* Some of the layers are also implemented on intermediary networking devices such as Routers:
* This is because the functionality associated with these layers is needed for a particular purpose such as: frame reception / transmission, packet routing etc.
* The following slide shows how the complete set of layers are implemented on the end-hosts as well as on the intermediary networking devices.
