A transmitted signal becomes distorted due to <mark style="background:#69E772;">transmission impairments</mark>

For <mark style="background:#69E772;">Analogue</mark> signals, the quality can become <mark style="background:#69E772;">degraded</mark>

For <mark style="background:#69E772;">Digital</mark> signal, <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit errors</mark> can be introduced

Types of Impairment:
- Attenuation and Attenuation distortion
- Noise

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation and Attenuation distortion:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation</mark> - where the signal becomes weaker over distance

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation</mark> is a function of <mark style="background:#69E772;">frequency</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation distortion</mark> affects the <mark style="background:#69E772;">intelligibility</mark> of the received signal, especially <mark style="background:#69E772;">signal pulses</mark> which can become distorted

One technique for addressing this problem is to use equalising amplifiers. This boosts higher frequency components which evens out signal pulses

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Noise:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Noise</mark> is the insertion of unwanted signals onto the transmission signal. Its effect is to distort the signal during transmission (refer to diagram on slide entitled Effects of Impulse and Thermal Noise)

It particularly affects digital signals, the greater the noise the greater the <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit error rate</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Three categories of Noise:</mark>
- Thermal Noise
- Cross talk
- Impulse Noise	

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Thermal Noise:</mark>

Caused by the thermal agitation of electrons within a conductor

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Present in all electronic devices and conductors
- It is a function of <mark style="background:#69E772;">temperature</mark> i.e. increased temperature leads to increase in thermal noise
- It is uniformly distributed across frequency spectrum, also known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">white noise</mark>
	
The presence of Thermal Noise places an upper limit on the data carrying capacity of a transmission system
- Must ensure that the strength of the data-carrying signal is much greater than the noise signal
- Term used to describe this relationship is <mark style="background:#69E772;">SNR</mark> (Signal to Noise Ratio)


### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Cross Talk:</mark>

Unwanted <mark style="background:#69E772;">coupling</mark> between signals on neighbouring transmission paths
- The term <mark style="background:#69E772;">coupling</mark> means connecting without actually touching
- Coupling can occur between cables in close proximity or between radio signals close to the same frequency	

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Impulse Noise:</mark>

Irregular pulses or <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise spikes</mark> of short duration and high amplitude

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Causes:</mark>
- Lightning and heavy static charges
- Switching of heavy electrical loads
- Faults within the transmission system
	
Analogue signals are less affected by this type of noise, e.g. a voice transmission, whilst affected by impulse noise, can still be received intelligibly

Digital signals are very susceptible, it can lead to corruption of data i.e. changing one to zero and vice versa

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Channel Capacity:</mark>

Channel capacity allows us to study the inter-relationships between Signal BW, System BW and Signal Impairments

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Channel Capacity</mark> is the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a communications path or channel

The objective is to make the best use of a given bandwidth/channel, however channel capacity is limited in practice by transmission impairments of which the main constraint is <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise</mark>

Two distinguished scientists on this topic: Nyquist and Shannon

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Nyquist's Noise Free Channel:</mark>

According to Nyquist, the limitation on data rate is simply the bandwidth of the channel

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Nyquist's theorem:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/27E61eO.png)

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">C</mark> = Maximum data rate measured in bits per sec
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">B</mark> = Bandwidth of the transmission system Hz
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">M</mark> = Number of discrete states in digital signal


### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Limitation on Channel Capacity:</mark>

It appears from Nyquist's theorem that any data rate is achievable by:
- Increasing the bandwidth of the system
- Encoding more bits per cycle

However, as the Data Rate increases:
- The <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit error rate</mark> increases
- It becomes more and more difficult for the receiver to distinguish different signal <mark style="background:#69E772;">states</mark>

Noise and other transmission impairments put a practical limit on M, hence the maximum Data Rate achievable

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Noise and Data Rate:</mark>

Noise distorts a signal during transmission

The greater the noise the greater the bit error rate for digital signals

Key factor is Signal to Noise Ration (SNR)

Measured in Decibels

<mark style="background:#69E772;">S</mark> = Average signal power

<mark style="background:#69E772;">N</mark> = Average noise power

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Shannon's Noisy Channel:</mark>

Shannon extended Nyquist's work and took into account the effects of <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise</mark>

Shannon's Capacity Formula:

![](https://i.imgur.com/rBu9A21.png)

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Observations:</mark>
- Increasing the bandwidth increases the maximum data rate
- Increasing the noise reduces the maximum data rate
- Shannon's Law defines an upper limit on the achievable data rate
- Hence the data rate is limited by <mark style="background:#69E772;">bandwidth</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Limitation on Channel Capacity:</mark>

According to Shannon the maximum data rate achievable is determined by:
- The bandwidth of the system/channel and,
- The noise on the channel
- i.e. every system/channel has a maximum data carrying capacity that cannot exceeded

This is a more practical and realistic reflection on Channel Capacity as it takes into consideration the effects of noise
