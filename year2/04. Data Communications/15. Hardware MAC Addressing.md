### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Addressing:</mark>

LAN technologies facilitate sharing of information between <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> locally connected stations

Direct communication between specific pairs of stations is achieved using an <mark style="background:#69E772;">addressing scheme</mark>

Each station is assigned a <mark style="background:#69E772;">UNIQUE</mark> address called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Address</mark> or a <mark style="background:#69E772;">MAC Address</mark>

An example of an Ethernet MAC address is: <mark style="background:#69E772;">00:40:05:1c:0e:9f</mark>

Ethernet MAC addresses are 48-bit long and are usually represented in Hex format; 12 Hex digits, each digit representing 4 bits

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Addressing in Frames:</mark>

The header within each transmitted frame contains the addresses of the sender and receiver

This allows the LAN interface card (<mark style="background:#69E772;">Network Interface Card</mark> aka <mark style="background:#69E772;">NIC</mark>) to filter out frames without conferring with the CPU:

The NIC only interrupts the CPU when it has data specific to the station

All other frames are discarded

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Addressing Allocation:</mark>

Different addressing schemes are employed on different LAN topologies.

Each stationâ€™s address must be unique on the LAN to which it connects.

Address allocation falls into three categories:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Static:</mark> The h/w manufacturer sets the address
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Dynamic:</mark> Stations sets their address at boot-up
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Configurable:</mark> The admin sets the address

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Types of Communication:</mark>

There are three types of communication possible on a LAN:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Unicast:</mark> This is station-to-station communication.
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Broadcast:</mark> This is station-to-ALL stations communications.
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Multicast:</mark> This is station-to-SOME station communications.

Each type of communication requires its own address.

Unicast communication requires the use of unique MAC addresses. All NICs are configured with a unique MAC address.

Broadcast communication requires one address to be recognised by all stations: All NICs are configured to recognised the broadcast address of all ones (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)

Multicast communications require one address to be recognised by some stations.
