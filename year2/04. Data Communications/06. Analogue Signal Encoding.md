<mark style="background:#69E772;">Modulation</mark> is the technique used to encode Digital Data onto an Analogue signal:

Here a <mark style="background:#69E772;">carrier signal</mark> (a sine wave operating at frequency fc) is modified to represent the data stream

Recall that sine waves have three characteristics that can be modified:
- Amplitude
- Frequency
- Phase

When viewed in the frequency domain, the modified carrier signal can be seen to have a bandlimited (fixed range) spectrum centred on fc
- This spectrum can be considered as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">channel</mark> through which data passes,
- Other channels can be created using other carrier signals operating at different distinct frequencies

Most Common application for modulation:
- The transmission of digital data across the <mark style="background:#69E772;">Plain old Telephone System</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">PoTS</mark>)
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">PoTS</mark> was designed for transmission of analogue voice

The resultant modulated analogue signal is in the voice-frequency range. Recall this is approximately 400-4000 hertz

To facilitate full duplex communications a combined modulator/demodulator or <mark style="background:#69E772;">MODEM</mark> is used

Three modulation techniques exist:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Amplitude shift keying:</mark> This involves representing data using two or more different <mark style="background:#69E772;">amplitudes</mark> e.g. A1, A2 etc.
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frequency shift keying:</mark> This involves representing data using two or more different <mark style="background:#69E772;">frequencies</mark> e.g. f1, f2 etc.
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Phase shift keying:</mark> This involves representing data using two or more different phase shifts e.g. π, π/4 etc.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Shift keying concepts:</mark>

With each techniques the modulator can be considered as having two inputs:
- One input for the data stream
- Another for the carrier signal is then passed to the output of the modulator

The modified or modulated carrier signal is then passed to the output of the modulator

In reality, only the data input exists, the carrier input is used for explanation purposes only

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">The Modulator:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Amplitude Shift Keying:</mark>

With <mark style="background:#69E772;">ASK</mark>, the modulator modifies the amplitude of the carrier signal

It allows one of the following to pass to the output:
- a Full amplitude carrier signal, or,
- a Zero amplitude carrier is passed to the output

For encoding purposes the following rules apply:
- To encode a binary zero (Space) the Zero amplitude carrier is passed to the output
- To encode a binary one (Mark) the Full Amplitude carrier is passed to the output

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Example ASK waveform:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frequency Shift Keying Example:</mark>

For this technique, the modulator can be considered as having access to <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> other signals:
- One operating at frequency f1 Hz.
- Another operating at f2 Hz,
- Where f1 < fc < f2 and where fc is the frequency around which the modulated signal is to be centred.

For encoding purposes the following rules apply:
- To encode a binary zero (Space) the f1 signal is passed to the output
- To encode a binary one (Mark) the signal f2 is passed to the output

The following shows an example of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Full Duplex</mark> communications using FSK signals across the PoTS:
- The term <mark style="background:#69E772;">Full Duplex</mark> communication means communicating in both directions simultaneously
- This can be achieved because analogue signals can <mark style="background:#69E772;">co-exist</mark> on a single transmission path provided they are of different frequencies

![](https://i.imgur.com/tfLYQmM.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Uplink and Downlink Channels:</mark>

As can be seen, each direction of communication occurs in separate spectrums with each spectrum representing a separate <mark style="background:#69E772;">channel of communication</mark>:
- An <mark style="background:#69E772;">Uplink</mark> channel (centred on 1170 Hz.)
- A Downlink channel (centred on 2125 Hz.)

The combined spectrum of both channels exists within the bandwidth of the PoTS link i.e. 4KHz

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Phase Shift Keying Example:</mark>

With PSK the modulator can transmit the input carrier signal in one of two forms:
- In-phase i.e. without modification, or,
- Phase-shifted by radians or degrees

For encoding purposes the following rules apply:
- To encode a binary zero (Space) the in-phase carrier is passed to the output without modification
- To encode a binary one (Mark) the carrier is shifted by radians as it is passed to the output

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Shift Keying Analysis:</mark>

With each of the shift keying techniques outlined above, the following analysis can be considered:
- With each technique two versions of the carrier were used to represent the data i.e. <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> different amplitudes, <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> different frequencies or <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> different phases
- This represents <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> different <mark style="background:#69E772;">levels</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Recall Nyquist's channel capacity formula:</mark>

C = 2Blog<sub>2</sub>M

![](https://i.imgur.com/dNcITrt.png)


The M value represents the number of levels. For each of the techniques considered above the number of levels is 2


Analogue encoding techniques allow for larger M values to be used as follows:

Consider the case with <mark style="background:#69E772;">Quadrature PSK</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Quadrature PSK:</mark>

Similar to PSK except the modulator can transmit the input carrier signal in one of <mark style="background:#69E772;">four</mark> forms:
- In-phase i.e. without modification
- Phase shifted by multiples of radians or 90 degrees.

Using this technique provides <mark style="background:#69E772;">four</mark> different levels to be used for encoding data
- This means the incoming bit stream can be divided into two-bit quantities with each two-bit quantity represented by a single modification of the carrier signal

For encoding purposes the following rules may be applied:
- To encode 00, the previously modified carrier is passed to the output without further modification,
- To encode 01 the previously modified carrier is shifted by (¶/2)r adians and then passed to the output,
- To encode 10 the previously modified carrier is shifted by (2 x ¶/2 or ¶) radians and then passed to the output,
- To encode 11 the previously modified carrier is shifted by (3 x ¶/2 ) radians and then passed to the output.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Example QPSK Waveform:</mark>

Consider the following bit stream: 11010110110

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Modulation Rate V Bit Rate revisited:</mark>

Previously the relationship between data rate and mod rate was shown to be related as follows
- D = R/b
- Where D = mod rate, R = Data Rate and b = bits per sig. element

It can also be expressed as:

![](https://i.imgur.com/SRnLwt0.png)

Where L = # of levels per signal element

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Modulation Rate for PSK and QPSK:</mark>

Recall that the BW of the transmission system limits the frequencies that can be transmitted, this in turn limits the data rate

From analysis of the Phase Shift Keying techniques it was shown that:
- PSK allows for one-bit encoding per signal element
- QPSK allows for two-bit encoding per signal element

If the carrier signal is transmitted at the maximum frequency allowed by Tx Sys BW then it is clear that the data rate is higher when using QPSK

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Conclusions:</mark>

In general the BW of a Transmission System can be increasingly optimised for Data Transmission by using more complex encoding techniques:
- PSK v QPSK

This is in line with Nyquist's channel capacity formula:
- C = C2Blog<sub>2</sub>M

![](https://i.imgur.com/FmEn2we.png)

Choosing QPSK over PSK improves the M value which in turn improves the Channel Capacity

There exists other analogue encoding techniques which further improves the number of bits per signal element:
- For example = 16-QAM and 256-QAM
- These techniques modify both the amplitude and phase of the carrier to represent data
