# <mark style="background: #69E772;">13. Intro to LANs:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Local Area Networks:</mark>
 
These are private communications networks:

They are are used to interconnect the computing resources within an organisation

All devices attach to a shared transmission medium. They can provide data rates up to 1 Gbps

<mark style="background:#69E772;">The rationale for interconnecting devices:</mark>
- Proliferation of computing devices,
- Growth in Multimedia applications,
- Increase in client/server application

<mark style="background:#69E772;">LANs can be classified according to:</mark>
- Their topology e.g. ring, star, bus
- The type of transmission medium used e.g. ThickNet, Thinnet
- How they access the shared Tx medium (aka as Access Control) e.g. CSMA, Token
 
### <mark style="background:#69E772;">There are three broad types of LANs:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">PC LANs (aka Access Layer):</mark>
- Used to connect low-cost devices e.g. PCs, small server devices, etc
- Used in most organisations
- These LANs are cheap to implement and maintain, consequently their performance and speed is low
    
<mark style="background:#69E772;">Backend LANs (aka Core Layer):</mark>
- Used to connect high-cost devices e.g. Mainframes, Supercomputers, mass storage devices
- Mainly used for the bulk transfer of data
- Used in large organisations
- These LANs are costly to implement and maintain, consequently their performance and speed is high

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Backbone LANs (aka Distribution Layer):</mark>
- Used to provide connectivity between PC LANs and backend LANs

<mark style="background:#69E772;">The use of a single LAN is not desirable:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Reliability:</mark> If the single LAN develops a fault the effects can be devastating
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Capacity:</mark> More devices connecting to LAN reduces its performance
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Cost:</mark> Connecting low-cost PC devices using the same type of LAN used to connect High Cost server devices would be impractical

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">LAN topologies:</mark>

There are three LAN topologies to consider: <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bus</mark>, <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ring</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Star</mark>.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bus LAN characteristics:</mark>

A <mark style="background:#69E772;">linear</mark> transmission medium is used

Each station attaches to the bus using a tap

There are no closed loops

Transmissions travel in both directions i.e. <mark style="background:#69E772;">bi-directional</mark>, and can be seen by <mark style="background:#69E772;">every</mark> attached device

The bus is terminated by a <mark style="background:#69E772;">terminator</mark> device which removes the transmission signal.

Example of a bus LAN is an <mark style="background:#69E772;">ethernet</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ring LAN characteristics:</mark>

Consists of a set of interconnected <mark style="background:#69E772;">repeaters</mark> (using point to point links) in a <mark style="background:#69E772;">ring</mark> configuration

Repeaters receive data on one link and transmit them <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit-by-bit</mark> onto another link

These links are <mark style="background:#69E772;">uni-directional</mark>

Each station attaches at a <mark style="background:#69E772;">repeater</mark>

The transmission signal must be <mark style="background:#69E772;">physically</mark> removed from the network

Example of a ring LAN is the <mark style="background:#69E772;">IBM Token Ring</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Star LAN characteristics:</mark>

Consists of a central <mark style="background:#69E772;">hub</mark> component of which there are two types:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Shared-medium</mark> hub
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Switched-LAN</mark> hub

Each station is attached by two links (<mark style="background:#69E772;">transmit</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">receive</mark>)

All transmissions travel via the Hub device

Example of a star LAN is an ATM
### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Common Characteristics of LANs:</mark>

Data is transmitted in small blocks known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">frames</mark>.

Each frame contains <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> plus <mark style="background:#69E772;">Control Information</mark> (similar to HDLC)

Stations must gain access to the shared medium transmission

Access must be provided on a fair and equitable basis i.e. there must be some controlling mechanism employed
