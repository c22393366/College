### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Two types of Data Transmission:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Serial:</mark> one bit at a time,

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Parallel:</mark> more than one bit at a time on several channels, typically 8, 16 or 32 bits

This course is primarily concerned with <mark style="background:#69E772;">Serial</mark> data transmission

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data Communications Techniques:</mark>

Data is typically transmitted one bit at a time over a <mark style="background:#69E772;">channel</mark>

A high degree of co-operation is required between communicating devices

The timing (rate, duration and spacing) must be <mark style="background:#69E772;">identical</mark> for both <mark style="background:#69E772;">receiver</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">transmitter</mark>

For example, if a Transmitter device is "clocking-out" bits at 1 Mbps to ensure successful communications

To successfully receive the data bits the <mark style="background:#69E772;">Receiver</mark> device must <mark style="background:#69E772;">sample</mark> the incoming bit stream <mark style="background:#69E772;">once</mark> every <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit interval</mark>:
- Consequently it must know the duration of <mark style="background:#69E772;">each</mark> bit
- For a 1mbps transmission the <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit interval</mark> (or <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit duration</mark>) is 1 millionth of a second

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Timing</mark> is achieved on both sides (i.e. at the receiver <mark style="background:#69E772;">and</mark> transmitter) using an internal electronic clock

To achieve successful communications, these clocks must sometimes be <mark style="background:#69E772;">synchronised</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Three Possibilities for achieving synchronisation:</mark>
- Using separate clock link - not viable for computer-to-computer communications as it's too expensive
- Ignore the potential synchronisation problems by sending very short bursts of data. This is called <mark style="background:#69E772;">Asynchronous</mark> transmission
- Embed clocking pulses within the data signal. This is called <mark style="background:#69E772;">Synchronous</mark> transmission, this <mark style="background:#69E772;">framing</mark> approach is more commonly used

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Asynchronous Transmission and Timing problems:</mark>

The <mark style="background:#69E772;">start</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">stop</mark> bits determine where a character starts and ends

This function is called <mark style="background:#69E772;">framing</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantage:</mark> Simple and cheap. Typically used between keyboard and PC

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Disadvantage:</mark> The overhead is typically 20% i.e. 2 framing bits plus 8 data bits

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Synchronous Transmission:</mark>

Here the data bits are transmitted in a large block of bits which has a particular structure: This structure is known as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame</mark>

The Receiver must be able to identify the start and end of a frame. This is achieved by using a special bit pattern for the <mark style="background:#69E772;">preamble</mark> (start of frame) and <mark style="background:#69E772;">postamble</mark> (end of frame)

Additional <mark style="background:#69E772;">control information</mark> is also sent within the frame to provide extra functionality.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Generic Synchronous Frame Structure:</mark>

In general, frames have a well-defined structure which is comprised of any number of distinct fields:
- A <mark style="background:#69E772;">preamble</mark> field, or <mark style="background:#69E772;">Opening Flag</mark>, at the start of the frame
- A <mark style="background:#69E772;">post-amble</mark> field, or Closing Flag, at the end of the frame
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Control</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">Information</mark> fields in between
- The exact format of the frame depends upon the <mark style="background:#69E772;">data link protocol</mark> being used. Different structures will be examined later
