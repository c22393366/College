### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">How to access a file in Python?</mark> 

A <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">file</mark> is a collection of bytes of information that usually permanently resides on a disc

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Accessing a file</mark> means establishing a connection between the file and the program, and moving data between the two

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Types of files:</mark> 

Files come in two general types:

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Text files:</mark> Files where control characters such as ``\n`` are translated. These are generally human readable

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Binary files:</mark> All the information is taken directly without translation. Not readable and contains non-readable info. 

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Buffering:</mark> 

Reading from a disc is very slow

The computer will read a lot of data from a file in the hopes that, if you need data in the future, it will be buffered in a file object

This means that a file object contains a copy of information from the file called a <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">cache</mark> 

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Making a file object:</mark> 


```Python
my_file = open("my_file.txt", "r") 
```

`my_file` is the file object, it contains the buffer of information

The `open()` function creates the connection between the disk file and the file object

The first parameter is the file name, the second is the mode to open it. ("r" means it is open for reading)

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Where is the disk file?</mark> 

When opened, the name of the file can come in one of two forms: 
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Relative</mark>: `"file.txt"` assumes the file name is file.txt and it is located in the current program directory
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Absolute</mark>: `"c:\bill\file.txt"` is the absolute path and includes the directory path


### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Different modes:</mark> 


File open modes: 

| Mode | How Opened     | File Exists                                                 | File Does not exist          |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| "r"  | read-only      | Opens the file                                              | Error                        |
| "w"  | write-only     | Clears the file contents                                    | Creates and opens a new file |
| "a"  | write-only     | File contents left intact and new data appended at EOF      | Creates and opens a new file |
| "r+" | read and write | Reads and overwrites from the file's beginning              | Error                        |
| "w+" | read and write | clears the file contents                                    | Creates and opens a new file |
| "a+" | read and write | file contents left intact and you can read and write at EOF | Creates and opens a new file |


Be careful if you open a file in `"w"` mode. It sets an existing file's contents to be empty, <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">destroying any existing data</mark>.

The `"a"`  mode allows you to write to the end of an existing file without changing the existing contents

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Text Files use strings:</mark> 

When you are interacting with text files, remember that <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">everything is a string</mark>: 
- Everything read is a string 
- If you write to a file, you can only write a string
 
### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Writing to a file using print():</mark> 

Once you have created/opened a file object, you can use the print command to write it

You add ``file = file_object`` to the print command

```Python
temp_file = open("temp.txt", "w")
print("first line", file = temp_file)
print("second line", file = temp_file)
temp_file.close() 
```


### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">close():</mark> 

When the program is finished using the file, we must close it

Flush the buffer contents from the computer to the file

Tear down the connection to the file

`close()` is a method of a file object

`file_obj.close()` 

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">All files should be closed!</mark> 

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Why should you close files?</mark> 

1. It puts your program in the garbage collector's hands - though the file <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">in theory</mark> will be auto-closed, it may not be closed
2. It can slow down your program. Too many things are open, more space is used in RAM and this will impact performance
3. For the most part, many changes to files in Python do not go into effect until after the file is closed, so if your script edits, leaves open and reads a file, it won't see the edits.
4. You could, theoretically, run in to limits of how many files you can have open
5. Windows treats open files as locked, so other python scripts can't read the file
6. It is sloppy programming

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">write():</mark>  

`write()`  writes any string to an open file (text or binary)

It does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the string

```Python
file_obj = open("test.txt", "w")
file_obj.write("I love programming! \nIt is great! \n");
file_obj.close() 
```

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">read() and readline()</mark> 
 
`read(size)` reads a string from an open file (could be text or binary data)

```Python
#Open a file in 'r' (read) mode
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close() 
```

`size` - optional argument, a number representing the number of bytes to be read. If omitted, the whole file is read

`readline()` reads a single line from the file

```Python
#Open a file in 'r' (read) mode
file = open("example.txt", "r")
line1 = file.readline()
line2 = file.readline()
print("Line 1:", line1)
print("Line 2:", line2)
file.close() 
```

A newline character is left at the end of the string and is only omitted on the last line of the file, if the file doesn't end in a newline

`readlines()` returns a list of all lines in a file

```Python
#Open a file in 'r' (read) mode
file = open("example.txt", "r")
lines = file.readlines()
for line in lines:
print(line)
file.close() 
```
 
### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">for-loop for reading a file:</mark> 

```Python
for line in file_obj:
#do something
line represents a single line in the file
loop ends when no more lines
```

The loop iterates over the lines of the file

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">with statement:</mark> 

You can open a file using the `with` statement - it automatically makes sure that the file is closed when finished processing:

```Python
with open("test.txt", "w") as file_obj:
file_obj.write("Hello World")
```
 
### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">EXCEPTIONS:</mark> 

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Dealing with "problems":</mark> 

Most modern languages provide methods to deal with "exceptional" solutions

Gives the programmer the option to keep the user from having the program stop without warning

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Example of errors:</mark>  
- Indexing past the end of the list
- Trying to open a non-existent file
- Division by zero
- Using a variable before assigning a value

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Error Names:</mark> 

Errors have specific names and appear in the traceback

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Built-In Exceptions:</mark> 
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">ZeroDivisionError</mark>: division by zero
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">EOFError</mark>: reaching EOF and looking for input()
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">IOError</mark>: input/output operation fails e.g. non-existing file
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">ImportError</mark>: import statement fails
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">NameError</mark>: unknown identifier (variable)
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">ValueError</mark>: Invalid type for arguments

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Handling Exceptions</mark>: If you suspect your code may raise an exception you can place it in a `try` block and handle the program cleaner, rather than just exiting the program

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Basic idea of a try block:</mark> 

Keep watch on a particular section of code

If we get an exception, it will raise/throw that exception (let it be known)

Look for a catcher that can handle that kind of exception

If found, handle it, otherwise let Python handle it

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Doing better with input:</mark> 

In general, we have assumed that the input we receive is correct

This is almost never true, there is always a chance that the input could be wrong

Our programs should be able to handle this

Most security holes in programs are based on assumptions programmers make about input

Secure programs protect themselves from evil input

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">try-except:</mark>

```Python
try:
suite
except some_error:
suite
```

You can have several except clauses to handle different exceptions

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Try:</mark> 

The `try` suite contains code that we want to monitor for errors during its execution

If an error occurs anywhere in that `try` suite, Python looks for a handler that can deal with the error

If no special handler exists, then Python itself handles it, meaning the program halts with an error message

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Except:</mark> 

An `except` suite is associated with a `try` suite

Each exception in the `except` names a type of the exception it is monitoring for.

If the error that occurs in the `try` suite matches the type of exception, then that `except` suite is activated

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Try/Except group:</mark> 

If there is no exception in the `try` suite, skip all the `except` blocks to the next line of code

If an error occurs in a `try` suite, look for the right exception

If found, run that `except` suite and then skip past the `try/except` group to the next line of code

If no exception handling is found, give the error back to Python

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Try-except-else:</mark> 


```Python
try:
	#some statements
except Exception1:
	#If there is an exception1, execute this block
except Exception2:
	#If there is an exception2, execute this block
else:
	#if there is no excpetion, execute this block     
```

The code in the else block is executed if the try block didn't raise an exception


```Python
try:
	file_obj = open("test.txt", "w")
	file_obj.write("Testing Exceptions")
except IOError:
	print("Error: no such file or can't write")
else:
	print("Written to file successfully")
	file_obj.close()
```

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">try-finally:</mark> 

```Python
try:
#some statements
finally:
#always execute this regardless of exceptions
```

The `finally` block always executes after the first `try`, regardless if an exception was raised

You <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">cannot</mark> use `else` and `finally` clauses together with a `try` block
