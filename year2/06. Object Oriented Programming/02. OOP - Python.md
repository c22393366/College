### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Programming Rules</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Rule 1:</mark>

Think before you program!

It is said that the goal of a program is not to run but to be read

A program communicates with other people as well. It stands as a document to be read, modified and run

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Rule 2:</mark>

- A program is a <mark style="background: #AD21D9;">human-readable</mark> essay on <mark style="background: #AD21D9;">problem solving</mark> that also happens to execute on a computer

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Why Python?</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Reasons for using Python:</mark>
- Simpler
- Best practices
- Open source
- Useful

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">1. Simpler:</mark>

Python is a high level language so there is a low cognitive load for the student
- There are fewer alternative ways to do things
- There are easier ways to accomplish tasks

This allows us to focus less on the language and more on problem solving

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">2. Best practices:</mark>

Many of the best parts of other languages are included in Python
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Control (iteration, exceptions)
- Many packages for common tasks

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">3. Open Source:</mark>
- Freely available
- Large user base constantly contributing
- New packages available to meet changing needs

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Compilation and Interpretation</mark>

Compiled languages produce an executable file:
- C/C++ ⇒ .exe file
- Java ⇒ .class file

Interpreted languages:
- Translated "on the fly"
- No executable
- Python is an interpreted language

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Variables</mark>

Variables refer to data in memory

Variable names are called <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">identifiers</mark>

You can name them using:
- A-Z
- a-z
- 0-9
- _

A small set of variable names are reserved as <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">keywords</mark>

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Statements</mark>

A program is a sequence of statements that python <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">interprets</mark> and <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">execute</mark>
- Import - access standard libraries
- Assignment - give a variable a value
- Print - create output

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Data Types, Expressions and Comments</mark>

Data Types:
- String, 
- Integer, 
- Float

Expressions:
- Something to evaluate, e.g. input, numeric using arithmetic operations
- arithmetic operations are: +, -, , /, //

Comments:
- ``# is a single line comment
- It is not interpreted, everything after the # is ignored
- It is very important to document your code!
