### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Python Standard Methods:</mark>


Python provides a number of standard methods which, if the class designer provides, can be used in a normal "Python" way

Many of these have the double underlines in the front and back of their names

By using these methods, we "fit in" to the normal Python flow

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Standard Method: Constructor</mark>

Constructor is called when an instance is made, and provides the class designer the opportunity to set up the instance with variables, by assignment

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Calling a constructor:</mark>

A constructor class is called by using the name of the class as a function call

```Python
student_inst = Student()
```


Creates a new instance using the constructor from class `Student`

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Defining the constructor:</mark>

One of the special method names in a class is the constructor name ``__init__``

By assigning the values in the constructor, every instance will start out with the same

You can also pass arguments to a constructor through its init method

<mark style="background: #AD21D9;">Example:</mark>

```Python

def __init__ (self, first='', last='', id=0):
	self.first_name_str = first
	self.last_name_str = last
	self.id_int = id
```


`self` is bound to the default instance as it is being made

If we want to add an attribute to that instance, we modify the attribute with self


```Python

s1 = Student()
print(s1.last_name_str)

>>>

s2 = Student(last='Python', first='Monty')
print(s1.last_name_str)

```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Default constructor:</mark>

If you don't provide a constructor, then only the default constructor is provided.

The default constructor does system stuff to create the instance, nothing more.

You cannot pass arguments to the default constructor.

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Every class should have __init__</mark>

By providing the constructor, we ensure that every instance, at least at the point of construction, is created with the same contents

This gives us some control over each instance

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">__str__, printing:</mark>

```Python

def __str__(self):
	return "{} {}, ID: {}".format(self.first_name_str, self.last_name_str, self.id_int)
```


When `print(my_inst)` is called, it is assumed, by Python, to be a call to “convert the instance to a string”, which is the <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">__str__</mark> method

In the method, `my_inst` is bound to `self`, and printing then occurs using that instance.

`__str__` <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">must return a string</mark>!


### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Summary:</mark>

Make sure your class does the right thing. A class should behave in a way similar to a Python Programmer e.g. the ability to call the print function on it.

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">OOP</mark> helps <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">software engineering</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Software Engineering</mark> is the discipline of <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">managing </mark>code to ensure its <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">long-term</mark> use

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">OOP:</mark>
- Takes existing code and modifies it
- Makes the overall code simpler, easier to understand
- Doesn't change the functionality, only the form

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Encapsulation means:</mark>
- Understanding the details of the underlying class structure should not be necessary to utilise an instance of a class
- Hide details of the implementation so that the program is easier to read and write

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Modularity:</mark> makes an object reusable in other other contexts, providing an interface (the methods) that are the approved way to deal with the class

Creating a new class creates a new type

A class is to its instance as a cookie cutter is to a cookie

Classes have attributes and methods that act on those attributes

Attributes are usually created within the `__init__` method

The identifier `self` refers to the current instance

The first parameter of methods is self


<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Class structure:</mark>

```Python
Class structure

class ClassName(object):
	def __init__(self, param1=4):
	self.att = param1 # create attribute.



def __str__(self):
	return "some string"

def some_method(self,param):
	# do something
```
