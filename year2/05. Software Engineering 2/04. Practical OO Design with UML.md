### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Specifying Behaviours:</mark>

Interaction diagrams:
- show how object behave in particular interactions
- do not specify all the possible behaviours of objects

Different notation is needed to summarise the overall behaviour of objects UML defines <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">statecharts</mark> for this purpose

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">State-dependent Behaviour:</mark>

Objects respond differently to the same stimulus at different times

This is modelled by defining a set of <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">states</mark>:
- an object can be in one state at any time
- the state it is in determines how it responds to <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">events</mark> detected or messages received
- in particular, an event can cause the object to move from one state to another (a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">transition</mark>)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">States, Events and Transitions:</mark>

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Statechart Semantics:</mark>

A <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">statechart</mark> defines the behaviour of instances of a given class

An object is in one <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">active state</mark> at a time

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Events</mark> may be received at any time

An event can <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">trigger</mark> a transition: a transition from the active state will <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">fire</mark> if it is labelled with the event just received    

The transition leads to the next active state

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Initial and Final States:</mark>

Model the creation and destruction of objects.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Non-determinism:</mark>

Sometimes there are two transitions with the same event label leaving a state

Some systems are non-deterministic but usually the non-determinism can be removed by adding more information

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Guard Conditions:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Conditions</mark> added to events indicate when a transition can fire

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Actions:</mark>

Actions are performed when a transition fires

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Entry and Exit Actions:</mark>

Entry and exit actions are properties of states

They are performed whenever an object arrives at or leaves the state, respectively.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Activities:</mark>

Activities are also properties of states
- they are performed while the object is in a state
- unlike actions, they can be interrupted by new events

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Completion Transitions:</mark>

If an activity completes uninterrupted it can trigger a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">completion transaction</mark>: these are transitions without event labels

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Internal Transitions:</mark>

Internal transitions do not change state and so do not execute entry and exit actions

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Composite States:</mark>

Composite states group together states, this can simplify a statechart by grouping together states with similar behaviour

An object still has one ‘bottom-level’ active state, but may be in a composite state as well.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Properties of Composite States:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Transitions:</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">from</mark> a composite state apply to all substates
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">to</mark> a composite state go to the state indicated by a nested initial state
- can cross composite state boundaries

Composite states can have activities and  entry and exit actions

A final state in a composite triggers a completion transition from the composite

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">History States:</mark>

Often an object needs to ‘return to the previous state’

This can be done by defining conditions (such as ‘if the last state was Playing’)

Composite states can have a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">history</mark> state
- this ‘remembers’ the last active substate    
- a transition to a history state makes that substate active again

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Use of a History State:</mark>

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Creating a Statechart:</mark>

It can be hard to identify all necessary states    

Statecharts can be developed incrementally    
- consider individual sequences of events received by an object
- these might be specified on interaction diagrams
- start with a statechart for one interaction
- add states as required by additional interactions

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Ticket Machine:</mark>

Consider a ticket machine with two events    
- select a ticket type
- enter a coin

Basic interaction is to select a ticket and then enter coins (model this as a ‘linear’ statechart)

![](https://i.imgur.com/O0epmBq.png)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Refining the Statechart:</mark>

This can be improved by adding ‘loops’    
- the number of coins entered will vary: entry will continue until the ticket is paid for
- the whole transaction can be repeated

![](https://i.imgur.com/xrzObU3.png)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Adding Another Interaction:</mark>

The user could enter a coin before selecting a ticket     
A ‘coin’ transition from the ‘Idle’ state is needed to handle this event    
- this transition can’t go to the ‘Paying for Ticket’ state as the ticket is not yet selected
- so a new state ‘Inserting Coins’ is required

The statechart is thus built up step-by-step.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Adding a Second Interaction:</mark>

If all coins are entered before ticket selected:

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Integrating the Interactions:</mark>

In fact, events can occur in any sequence:

![](https://i.imgur.com/dUpwGNi.png)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Time Events:</mark>

Suppose the ticket machine times out after 30 seconds 
- we need to fire a transition that is not triggered by a user-generated event
- UML define <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">time</mark> events to handle these cases

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Activity States:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Activity states</mark> defines periods of time when the object is carrying out internal processing
- unlike normal activities, these cannot be interrupted by external events
- only <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">completion</mark> transitions leading from them
- useful for simplifying the structure of complex statecharts

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Returning Change:</mark>
