### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Analysis:</mark>

What is to be analysed? The system requirements

Why? To demonstrate their implementability

How? By drawing interaction diagrams realising use cases

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">From Requirements get:</mark>
- Use-case descriptions which document external interactions with the putative software, known as external messages between actor and system
- Domain Model which defines the relationships between important business concepts

Analysis is about finding out how objects derived from the domain model can be made to cooperate in such a way as to implement behaviour described in use-cases

Hence the term, "use-case realisation"

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Analysis and UP:</mark>

Analysis in the UP mostly occurs in the Elaboration Phase

Use-case realisation leads to a more comprehensive class diagram, usually a reified version of the domain model

Besides use-case realisations, another important product of the analysis workflow is the <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Software Architecture Description (SAD)</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Analysis v. Design:</mark>

Difficult to draw a boundary

Traditional informal distinction:
- Analysis models the real-world system 
- Design models the software

Object-oriented methods use the same notation for both activities. This encourages '<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">seamless development</mark>' and iteration

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Object Design:</mark>

We need to define attributes and operations for each class in the model

Start from domain model, but:
- Structure of real-world application is not always the optimal structure for a software system
- Domain model does not show operations

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Realisation</mark> identifies operations and confirms that design supports functionality

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Object Responsibilities:</mark>

Each class in a system should have well-defined <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">responsibilities</mark>
- To manage a subset of the data in the system
- To manage some of the processing

The responsibilities of a class should be <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">cohesive</mark>
- They should <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">"belong together"</mark>
- They should form a sensible whole

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Software Architecture:</mark>

The UP analysis workflow includes the production of an <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">architectural description</mark>, the <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">SAD</mark>

This defines:
- The top-level structure of subsystems
- The role and interaction of these subsystems

Typical architectures are codified in <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">patterns</mark>, e.g. <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">layered architectures</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">A Layered Architecture:</mark>

Subsystems are shown as UML <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">packages</mark> linked by <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">dependencies</mark>

A dependency without a stereotype means <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">uses</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Separation of Concerns:</mark>

Layers aim to insulate a system from the effects of change

For example, user interfaces often change:
- But the application does not use the presentation layer
- So changes to system should be restricted to presentation layer classes

Similarly, details of persistent data storage are separated from application logic

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Analysis Class Stereotypes:</mark>

Within this architecture objects can have various typical roles:
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Boundary</mark> objects interact with outside actors
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Control</mark> objects manage use case behaviour
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Entity</mark> objects maintain data

These are represented explicitly in UML by using analysis class stereotypes

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Class Stereotype Notation:</mark>

Stereotypes can be text or a graphic icon

The icon can replace the normal class box

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Use-Case Realisation:</mark>

Begin with functionality in application layer

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'Display bookings'</mark>: simple dialogue
- The user provides the required date
- The system response is to update the display

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Initial realisation consists of:</mark>
- Instance of the <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">"Staff"</mark> actor
- An object representing the system
- Message(s) passed between them

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">System Messages</mark> - from outside the software to the software, i.e. from actor to software system. Could be clicking on an Ok button or entering a number. Documented in use-case descriptions

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Internal Messages</mark> - from object to object

The <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Unified Process</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">UP</mark>) advocates the use of a boundary class between the actor and application classes. It receives system messages

However, analysis modelling is chiefly concerned with use-case realisation within the application layer

A boundary class refers to the presentation layer so we can ignore it

In general, there are several system messages in a use-case and it is important that they are handled in the correct order and that appropriate objects respond to them

This is the role of a control object

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">System Messages:</mark>

System messages are sent by an actor

Represent system by a <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">controller</mark>, initially analysing use case behaviour, not I/O

![](https://i.imgur.com/S1yR7YW.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Sequence Diagrams:</mark>

Time passes from top to bottom

Instances of classes and actors at top
- Only show those participating in this interaction
- Each instance has a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">lifeline</mark>

Messages shown as arrows between lifelines
- Labelled with operation name and paramters
- Return messages (dashed) show return of control
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Activations</mark> show when receiver has control

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Accessing Bookings:</mark>

How does the system retrieve the bookings to display?

Which object should have the responsibility to keep track track of all bookings?
- If this was an additional responsibility of the BookingSystem control object it would lose cohesion
- Better to assign responsibility of keeping track of the booking entities to another object
- So define a new "Restaurant" object with the responsibility to manage booking data

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Retrieving Bookings:</mark>

Add a message to get relevant bookings

'updateDisplay' is an internal message. In actuality, it will be sent to presentation layer object

![](https://i.imgur.com/tDxA0a8.png)


Dates of individual bookings will need to be checked by the Restaurant object

![](https://i.imgur.com/UIlkXnY.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Refining the Domain Model:</mark>


New <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'Restaurant'</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'BookingSystem'</mark> classes, with an association between them

An association from <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'Restaurant'</mark> to <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'Booking'</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'Restaurant'</mark> maintains links to all bookings
- Messages sent from restaurant to bookings

An association from <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'BookingSystem'</mark> to <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'Booking'</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">'BookingSystem'</mark> maintains links to currently displayed bookings

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Updated Class Diagram:</mark>

Operations are derived from messages sent to the instances of a class

![](https://i.imgur.com/SrNCf0w.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Recording New Bookings:</mark>

Give 'Restaurant' responsibility for creation, don't model details of user input or data yet

![](https://i.imgur.com/wuWhDEy.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Creating a New Booking:</mark>

Bookings must be linked to table and customer objects. Responsibility of 'Restaurant' to retrieve these, given identifying data in booking details

New objects shown at point of creation:
- Lifeline starts from that point
- Objects created by a message arriving at the instance (a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">constructor</mark>)

![](https://i.imgur.com/LWQ5wG5.png)



### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Cancelling a Booking:</mark>

A three-stage process:
- Select on screen the booking to be cancelled
- Confirm cancellation with user
- Delete the corresponding booking object

Object deletion represented by a message with a 'destroy' stereotype, lifeline terminates with an 'X'

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Role</mark> <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">names</mark> are used to distinguish selected object from others displayed

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/OdteGDH.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Refining the Domain Model (2)</mark>

'BookingSystem' has the responsibility to remember which booking is selected

Add an association to record this

![](https://i.imgur.com/PW6vJdl.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Recording Arrival:</mark>

- Selected booking must be a reservation

![](https://i.imgur.com/gmm9LZj.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Class Interface Design:</mark>

Should 'setArrivalTime' be defined in Booking or Reservation class?
- On one hand, it doesn't apply to walk-ins
- But we want to preserve a common interface to all bookings if possible

Define operation in 'Booking' class:
- Default implementation does nothing
- Override in 'Reservation' class

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Refined Class Hierarchy:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Summary:</mark>

Analysis has led to:
- A set of use-case realisations
- A refined class diagram
 
We can see how the class design is going to support the functionality of the use cases

This gives confidence that the overall design will work
