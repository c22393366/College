### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile Methodologies:</mark>

Traditional IS development methodologies "are treated primarily as a necessary fiction to represent an image of control or to provide a symbolic status"

Lightweight alternative to traditional heavyweight processes

Began with introduction of extreme programming (XP) by Beck in 1999.

Agile manifesto in 2001

A number of other methods have been invented or rediscovered since

However, no clear agreement on how to distinguish Agile from Traditional Methodologies

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile values:</mark>

Â  Individuals and interactions over tools and processes

Working software over comprehensive documentation - continuously turn out working tested software

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change rather than following a plan - adaptive rather than prescriptive

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile characteristics & principles:</mark>

Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

Incremental and timebound with short iteration cycles from 1 to 6 weeks

Development group consists of both software developers and customer representatives. Regular feedback is given to developers. Authorised to consider adjustments during developments.

Working software is the primary measure of progress

What is new is the recognition of people as the primary drivers of project success along with intense focus and manoeuvrability

Fully automated regression testing testing

Experienced developers - speeds up project by a factor anywhere from 2 to 10 times

Minimal process overheads, remove unnecessary process activities

Modelling tools are not as useful as generally thought

Continuous attention to technical excellence, e.g. refactoring in XP

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile methodologies:</mark>

- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Scrum
- Crystal
- Feature driven development
- UP?

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP Lifecycle:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Exploration Phase:</mark>

Customers write story cards for first release

Each story card describes features of system (like a brief use-case)

Project team familiarise themselves with tools, technology and practices they use in the project.

Try out tools and explore possibilities for architecture via prototyping

Phase can take from a few weeks to a few months

Set priorities from a few weeks to a few months

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Planning phase:</mark>

Set priority for stories

Agree contents of first small release

Estimate effort for each story and agree schedule

First release normally not more than two months

Planning phase itself takes a couple of days

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Iterations to Release Phase:</mark>

Several iterations from 1 to 4 weeks

First iteration creates a system with architecture for the whole system

Select story that will enforce building of structure for whole system

Customer selects stories for each iteration

Functional tests created by customer run at the end of each iteration

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Productioning Phase:</mark>

Requires extra testing and performance checking before being released to a customer

New changes may still be found

Shorter iterations

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Maintenance and Death Phase:</mark>

Keep system in production while producing new increments

Requires effort for customer support tasks

Development speeds may slow

Maybe incorporate new people into team

Death phase - no more stories to be implemented, or if system not delivering desired outcomes or is proving too expensive for development

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP Roles:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Programmer</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Customer</mark> - writes stories and functional tests

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Tester</mark> - gives feedback on schedule to team

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Coach</mark> - has sound understanding of XP

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Consultant</mark> - specific technical knowledge

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Manager</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP Practices:</mark>

Planning game

Small short releases

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Simple design</mark> - simplest possible design that is implementable at the moment

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Testing</mark> - development is test driven. Unit tests are implemented before code and run continuously. Customers write functional tests

Refactoring

Pair programming

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Collective ownership</mark> - anyone can change any part any time.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Continuous integration</mark> - new piece of code integrated into code-base as soon as it is ready. System integrated and built many times daily. All tests run and have to be passed for change to be accepted.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">XP Key Practices Described:</mark> 

(Not given in notes)

1. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Test-Driven Development (TDD):</mark> Development is test driven. Unit tests are implemented before code and run continuously. Customers write functional tests

2. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Pair Programming:</mark> Involves two developers working together at one workstation. One developer writes the code while the other reviews each line as it is typed. Roles can be switched frequently. Pair programming promotes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous code review, resulting in higher-quality code with fewer defects.

3. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Continuous Integration (CI):</mark> new piece of code integrated into code-base as soon as it is ready. System integrated and built many times daily. All tests run and have to be passed for change to be accepted.

4. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Refactoring:</mark> the practice of improving the internal structure of the code without changing its external behaviour. XP encourages developers to refactor code continuously to keep it clean, maintainable, and adaptable. Refactoring helps in reducing technical debt, improving code readability, and facilitating future changes and enhancements.

5. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Simple Design:</mark> XP advocates for keeping the design of the software as simple as possible while still meeting the requirements. Simple design focuses on minimizing unnecessary complexity, duplication, and dependencies in the codebase. It emphasizes clarity, flexibility, and ease of understanding. Simple designs are easier to maintain, evolve, and refactor.

6. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">On-Site Customer:</mark> XP promotes direct and continuous involvement of the customer or product owner throughout the development process. Having an on-site customer allows for real-time feedback, clarification of requirements, and prioritization of features. This close collaboration ensures that the development team builds the right product that aligns with customer needs and expectations.

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP - Scope of Use:</mark>

Small to medium sized teams, 3 to 20 project members

Communication between members at all times, even scattering across two floors is not acceptable

Any resistance by team members, management or customers may fail the process

Growing research

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Scrum:</mark>

Developed for managing the Systems Development process.

No specific software development technique, can be adopted to manage an organisation's own engineering practices

Focuses on flexibility of team members in producing software in a constantly changing environment

Frequent management activities to identify and rectify any impediments in the development process

Suitable for small teams of less than 10.

Development relies on several Environmental and technical variables which are likely to change
- Requirements
- Time frame
- Resources
- Technology
- Development Methods

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Scrum Lifecycle:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zef2rMa.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Scrum - 3 phases:</mark>

Pregame phase, which consists of 2 sub-phases
- Planning
- Architecture and High-level design

Development or Game Phase
Postgame phase

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Pregame planning sub-phase:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Product Backlog list:</mark>
- All requirements that are currently know
- Prioritised
- Development effort estimated

Includes definition of team, tools and other resources

Risk Assessment

Training needs

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Pre-game architecture sub-phase:</mark>

High level design of system including architecture planned based on current Product Backlog

For enhancement to an existing system, changes needed for implementing backlog are identified along with any problems they may cause.

Design review meetings are held to go over proposals. Decisions are made on the basis of this review

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Development or Game Phase:</mark>

Agile part of Scrum, unpredictable expected.

System developed in Sprints
- Iterative cycles where functionality is developed or enhanced to produce new increments.
- Included traditional development activities of analysis, design, implementation, delivery
- A Sprint is planned to last from 1 week to 1 month
- Could be 3 to 8 sprints in a system development process before ready for distribution.

Environment and technical variables are observed and controlled during sprints, not just at beginning.

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Postgame Phase:</mark>

- Entered when agreement reached that
- environmental variables such as requirements are completed
- System ready for release
- Integration
- System Testing
- Documentation
