        - Brought peace and prosperity

        - Introduced equality for Roman Citizens

        - 500AD Roman Army leave and chaos ensues

        - England invaded by the Angles and Saxons

        - Roman Law and learning left no trace

        - Invaders laws varied across the country

        - Crude concepts such as trial by combat, ordeal or immersion

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Compurgation:</mark> repeating an oath word-perfect without stumbling

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Tithing:</mark> Used to force communities to police themselves

        - Later, Christian missionaries from Ireland/the Continent gradually restored Christianity and literacy

        - Viking Invasions produced further periods of chaos

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">English Feudal Law:</mark>

        - William ruled through land ownership

        - He owned all of England as King

        - He granted large segments to his great vassals (Barons and Lords)

        - Subject to service, fealty and homage

        - Otherwise forfeited - Coroner

        - They sub-granted to mesne Lords, etc.

        - Land Occupiers (serfs) has no titles, they were tenants at will

        - Land granted to Bishops: different duties

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Feudal Courts:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Curia Regis:</mark>

            - Assisted king with the legislative, administrative, judicial process

            - Later evolved into courts ⇒ Specialisation through divisions

            - Landlords held Manorial Courts

            - Existing local courts were continued

            - Later, Great vassals were called to parley re: taxes (Origin of Parliament)

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Feudal Supervision of Local Courts:</mark>

            - Sheriffs supervised Manorial Courts

            - Justices of the Peace supervised local courts

            - Soldiers assisted Sheriffs and Justices Enforcement by <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">tithing</mark>: dividing the population into groups of 10

            - If a serious offence was committed by any member of the tithe, the entire tithe was punished. The population policed themselves

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Evolution of Common Law:</mark>

        - William made few new laws/decrees

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Courts' function:</mark> to enforce existing laws

        - Uniformity was achieved through central control of the court system by sheriffs and justices in the centralised sitting of the principal courts

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Stare Decisis (Precedent):</mark>

            - A matter that was decided by the King's Court meant all similar future cases would be handled in the same way.

            - Therefore Common Law is found in the decisions of the judges, not in local customs

            - Ancient custom is not usually a source of law today, rare exceptions include the "Foyle Fisheries case"

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Parliament:</mark>

    - Norman kings are continually at war in Europe

    - King had to constantly look to their barons for funds

    - King had called meetings of the great vassals (barons, lords and bishops) to parley ("parler")

    - In order to vote, money had to be transferred to the king

    - Later parliament began to prevent petitions

    - "Bills" in return for voting money

    - "Bills" became Acts or Statutes of Parliament that were legally binding due to the King's signature

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Magna Carta, 1215:</mark>

        - In 1215 a group of Barons waylaid King John at Runnymede, forced him to sign a document, the Magna Carta

        - It curtailed the arbitrary powers of the king

        - Some Irish barons were involved, as well as William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke

        - Norman-Irish were aware of how an Irish king's powers were curtailed under Brehon Law

        - King had to recognise the rights and liberties of the lords and barons, of the Church, and of free men (land owners)

        - Introduced "Juries": No freeman was to be convicted henceforth for any crime, except by the verdict of a jury of his peers

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Houses of Parliament:</mark>

        - City and borough now called to Parliament (Commons)

        - Lords and Commons met separately (origin of House of Commons and Lords)

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Bill of Rights, 1689:</mark>

        - Power shifts to Parliament

        - After the restoration of the Stuart kings, James II began to act in an arbitrary manner, ignoring parliament.

        - The parliamentarians removed him from the throne and offered the kingship to his son in law, William of Orange, conditional on William's signing the Bill of Rights, which obliged him to call the parliament at least once every year to approve the king's proposed expenditure and the taxation of the realm. Since then parliament has been the real power, the monarch's signature being a rubber stamp on the law.

        - A common culture, but no centralised state power

        - A "warrior" culture, which valued bravery and fostered conflict

        - Territories not fixed - 'wander lust of the celt'

        - Enclosed timber dwelling-houses in protective stone or earthen enclosures

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Hierarchical structure:</mark> king/learned men/druids, at the top, slaves at the bottom

        - Shared some legal concepts, if not entire legal systems. This is similar to concepts found in customary (tribal) laws in Africa, America and Asia;

        - No prisons: wrong was redressed by monetary compensation;

        - A debtor could be bonded to his creditor and sold to another, until the debt was repaid

        - Were relatively wealthy, with high protein diet, using salting and smoking as methods of preserving meat, cheese and butter-making as means of preserving dairy produce;

        - Did not have reading or writing learning was memorised and passed orally from generation to generation;

        - Declined with Vercingetorix (Arverni tribe) (52 BC) defeat by Caesar.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Celtic Ireland BC:</mark>

        - Legal system, known as the Brehon Laws

        - Laws in cryptic language,

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Triads:</mark> groups of three things or characteristics

        - Responsibility of the filí (poets, or learned people).

        - Verse formed discourse format (Question and Answer).

        - Passed on word perfect from one generation to another.

            - "There are three foundations of law and custom: order, justice, and peace."

            - "Three foundations of success: a silent mouth, a careful ear, and a fitting action"

        - Lawyer spent up to 20 years learning these laws verbatim

        - Tara, in County Meath, was a ritual centre from Neolithic times (4,000 BC). Whoever ruled Tara was considered High King of Ireland,

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Feis:</mark> a triennial gathering was held in Tara, attended by people from all over Ireland, with games, music and a conference of the brehons,

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Brehons = judges:</mark> had to know and apply the law.

        - King was subject to the Law.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Status:</mark>

            - Kings = druids = filí

            - Next in structure:

            - Brehons, medical specialists and harpists.

            - Princes (landowners with a certain number of tenants)

            - Landowners and then free tenants

            - Client-tenants (who were advanced cattle as well as land),

            - At the bottom were unfree tenants and bonded servants.

        - All free men attended a king's council also defended the realm

        - Approx. 150 kingdoms in Ireland.

        - In return for protection, local kings paid tribute to regional and/or provincial kings, provincial kings paid tribute to a High King

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ireland First Millenium:</mark>

        - Christianity merged with Brehon Law

        - Druids gradually replaced by Clergy

            - A Life for a Life

            - Death penalty for Rape

        - Where Christian sexuality required chastity outside of monogamous marriage, Brehon law allowed polygamy, divorce and trial marriages.

        - Sexual union (except by a prostitute) resulting in birth gave rise to rights and duties in law.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Levels of marriage:</mark>

            - Highest: formal agreement for marriage between two propertied persons,

            - Lowest: being a rape placing obligations on the man

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Bible v. Folklore:</mark>

            - Clergy tended to disregard the large body of learning and wisdom in folklore

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">After Colmcille:</mark> the clergy sponsored the recording in written form of much of the folklore and Brehon Laws

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">End of Tara (554 AD):</mark>

            - Implementation of " Life for Life" for protection of the lower orders as previously rich people often abused their positions, as the murder or rape persons of low honour-price only required payment a handful of silver to redeem themselves in law.

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Manifest Function</mark> of this demand was to protect common people from abuse by wealthy people

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Latent Function:</mark> As with any other law, it is the powerful who are best at turning the law to their own advantage.

            - High King Diarmuid took advantage of the tentative change of law to put a disagreeable subject to death,

            - Saint Ruadhán went to Tara with his followers in protest fasted against the king, it was believed he cursed Tara. Diarmuid's successor left Tara for good

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">1948:</mark> Republic of Ireland Act — removes External Affairs from Crown

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Courts:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Role of Courts as a Source of Law:</mark>

        - Which is to say that any instances where the same or similar facts have been applied to a rule (whether constitutional, statutory or an Sl) in the past are used by subsequent courts to clarify the rule to be followed in another case.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Result:</mark> case law tends to be more reliable, or at least not changed without good reason

            - Based to the rule of stare decisis a Latin expression meaning binding precedent,

            - Requires a court to apply a previous case decision in deciding the law in a present situation,

            - Based on the premise that like cases should be decided in the same way,

            - Part of the doctrine of <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">legal certainty</mark>

        - Doctrine of binding precedent means that the <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">ratio decidendi</mark> (reason for deciding or rule of law) from a higher court is binding on a lower court

        - Ratio decidendi is only binding to the extent that it is relevant for the claims being determined, or in point.

        - Obiter dictum are comments made by a judge in determining a case but which are not relevant for the claims being determined in that case, and which are for that reason not binding on another court. e.g. Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Persuasive Precedent:</mark>

        - Where a court though not bound may still follow a decision from another court.

        - Courts will also look further afield for persuasive authority — and therefore decisions in the United States, Australia, France, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, to name a few, will be relevant

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Benefits of Precedent:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Consistency:</mark>

            - Similar cases are treated in a similar manner,

            - Essential in a democracy.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Certainty:</mark> Easier to predict the result of a case which is of benefit to litigants and their legal advisors,

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Saves Time:</mark>

            - Because most cases will be covered by an existing precedent,

            - If there is no similar case, a judge will create a new precedent,

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Realistic:</mark> "forged on the anvil of reality", (contrast to legislation)

        - Legislation is intended to be clear and unambiguous,

        - However, it is possible that the form of expression used in legislation is not clear — and in these circumstances,

        - the statute in question is capable of being interpreted in different ways.

        - There are a number of techniques used by the courts to interpret statutes.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Rules for interpretation:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ejusdem generis</mark> ("of the same kind, class, or nature): where a statute contains general wording after a list of specific items, then the generality of those words should be read as being limited by the items listed to being items like those specifically listed.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</mark> ("expression of one thing is the exclusion of another") which means that including one specific item in a list or specifying one thing indicates that the legislature intended to exclude all others. This can only operate where words are not illustrative only.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Noscitur a sociis</mark> ("it is known from its associates"): which means that ambiguous words and phrases can be given a meaning from surrounding words and context.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Rule of Lenity:</mark> an approach which finds that criminal statutes should be construed narrowly.

        - Over time the courts have adopted different approaches to <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">interpreting statutes</mark>

        - Literal approach: where words are given their plain and ordinary meaning whether or not this leads to an absurd or harsh result,

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Golden rule:</mark> The current fashion is to interpret any ambiguous words in a statute in such a way as to give those words their plain and ordinary meaning, unless to do so would lead to an absurd result.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Mischief rule:</mark> allows the court to look behind the ordinary meaning of a word or phrase to identify the intent behind the expression given to it by Parliament (i.e. what 'mischief' did the wording seek to address).

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Purposive approach:</mark> which aims to interpret legislation in keeping with the purposes of the legislation and this approach is commonly used to interpret EU law.

        - Presidency of the Council rotates among members every six months, the lack of continuity can affect its effectiveness.

        - issues <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Regulations</mark>, <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Decisions</mark> and <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Directives</mark> which are legally binding

        - Resolutions, Conclusions, Recommendations, and Opinions which are not legally binding

        - The European Parliament is consulted by the Council on proposals, and where co-decision procedure (introduced in Maastricht in 1992) is used for law-making

        - Has extensive powers, and in particular the sole right to initiate legislation

        - Commission is the 'government' of the EU

        - It is divided into Directorates, e.g. Directorate of the Internal Market, and the Directorate of Justice and Social Affairs with regularity.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">European Parliament:</mark>

        - Provides democratic legitimacy to the law-making process within the EU

        - Has no right to introduce legislation itself and limited powers to veto law-making by the EU in general

        - Recently, its 2005 referral to the European Court of Justice of the Commission-sponsored agreement with the US administration for the transfer of airline passenger data to the US could be seen as increasing value of the EP in the legal process.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">European Court of Justice:</mark>

        - The <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">European Court of Justice</mark> (<mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">ECJ</mark>) — www.curia.eu.int - which decides matters which are referred to it by domestic courts within the European Union

        - The ECJ ensures the observance of law in the interpretation and application of the EU Treaty and the provisions laid down by the competent Institutions.

        - There is also a <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Court of First Instance</mark> (<mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">CFI</mark>), since 1989, which deals with direct actions brought by natural and legal persons but which cannot give Preliminary

        - Rulings (see below), and a Court of Auditors which oversees the implementation of the budget of the EU.

        - Procedure in the ECJ differs fundamentally from procedure in the domestic courts. First, it is important to note that there is no doctrine of stare decisis, or binding precedent. Any judgment is only binding on the parties to the dispute in question, and does not bind the ECJ when examining any future case.

        - The decisions of the ECJ are important reference points for interpreting issues of European Union law.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">European Law:</mark>

        - Found principally in the EC Treaties (e.g. The Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of the European Union (1992) i.e. The Maastricht Treaty),

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Directives</mark> are binding in terms of implementation, but the form of implementation into domestic law is left to each Member State

        - In the Francovich v. Italy case the European Court of Justice gave a citizen the right to damages where a Member State had failed to transpose a <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Directive</mark> into domestic law

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Opinions</mark>, <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Recommendations</mark>, <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Resolutions</mark> and Declarations are not enforceable, but can guide the courts on the underlying purpose of Community law

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Legislative Process:</mark>

        - Normally initiated by the Commission, intimated to Parliament and adopted by the Council of Ministers (or by the Council and Parliament)

        - Depending on the reaction of Parliament and/or the Council, the Commission has the option to alter its proposal.

        - The Council and Parliament may each also request the Commission to submit proposals.

        - The role or participation of the Parliament in the legislative process depends on the legislative procedure being used by the Commission.
