### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Introduction:</mark>

Communication is fundamental to being human.

Many features on today’s smart phones were inspired by people with difficulty communicating, seeing or hearing...

Accessibility of technological applications relates to interaction and application design that might be more inclusive . . . and now we use them all!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design:</mark>

Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be <mark style="background:#BABD00;">accessed</mark>, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">understood</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">used</mark> to the greatest extent possible by all people, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">regardless</mark> of their <mark style="background:#BABD00;">age</mark>, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">size</mark> or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">disability</mark>. - Disability Act 2005

In some countries, Universal Design is called ‘Design for all’ (EU) or ‘Inclusive Design’ (CA, UK).

Ireland is the only country that contains a definition of Universal Design in legislation, and that has established a statutory Centre for Excellence in Universal Design

Universal Design is closely related to other design processes such as User Centred Design and UX / CX (Universal eXperience, Customer eXperience).

To meet the needs of the widest range of users, consider the needs of diverse user groups.

Oversample the ‘tails’ on the distribution curve when conducting user research and testing!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design - Buildings and Places:</mark>

The more our buildings and places are designed to accommodate

The widest range of people possible, the more they work for everyone.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design and Diversity:</mark>

Universal Design places diversity at the heart of the design process so that buildings and environments can be used to meet the need of all people, regardless of their
- AGE
- SIZE
- ABILITY
- DISABILITY

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design - Public Services:</mark>

For any service (E.G. public transport) to be inclusive the technology, built environment and products the services use must work together.

Companies can really benefit from “Extending their range of users” by providing mainstream products and services that are easy to access, understand and use by everyone.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design = Accessibility? Not Quite</mark>

Universal Design is not a euphemism for accessibility.

Accessibility features such as ramps and lifts are ‘potent symbols of separateness’.

Universal Design promotes equality of access for all people

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design is Better Design:</mark>

Universal Design results in better designs for everyone, and the planet.

Universal Design is better design – it works first time for more people and is comfortable and easy to use

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Accessibility:</mark>

Accessibility is a general term used to describe the degree to which a product (for example, a device, service, environment) is accessible by as many people as possible.

As a term, accessibility also relates to the “ability to access” the functionality, and possible benefit, of some system or entity; considering people with disabilities and their right of access to entities.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Example: Blind Users and Computers:</mark>

Computer usage today is predominantly based on graphical interaction, where the visual presentation of information is essential both for input (hand-eye coordination when using a computer mouse), and output (seeing the information on a computer screen).

This can create difficulties for computer users with visual impairment, both at an individual level when interacting with a computer, and also when collaborating with other computer users

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Goals of Human Computer Interaction:</mark>

The goals of HCI are about allowing users to carry out tasks
- Safely
- Effectively
- Efficiently
- Enjoyably

including users with different abilities!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Improving Interfaces for All Abilities:</mark>

How do we improve interfaces for all?
1. Change the attitude of software professionals who think you can just “slap an interface on a system”,
2. Draw upon the fast-accumulating body of knowledge regarding human-computer interface design,
3. Integrate user-interface design methods and techniques into standard software development methodologies.

Know the user, and their:
- Physical abilities
- Cognitive abilities
- Personality differences
- Skill differences
- Cultural diversity
- Motivation
- Special needs

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Age and Accessibility:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/xX4y0px.png)

As this is a perspective on Accessibility, the Age aspect is on older, rather than younger users. So, as an interface designer, you might decide to simplify screen design, provide simple linear search spaces and increase the size of fonts and controls, among other things. You may have to find out more about the specific age and ability of the older user!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Classification of Aging:</mark>

“Elderly” = > 65 years

“Young Old” = 65 – 74 years

“Middle Aged Old” = 70 – 80 years

“Aged” = > 75 years

“Chronically Old” = > 70 years

“Oldest Old” = 80 years and more

Coleman, Heller and Leventhal (2003)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Everyone has Ability (Capacity to Sense):</mark>

Ability varies <mark style="background:#BABD00;">between</mark> individuals,

Ability varies <mark style="background:#BABD00;">within</mark> individuals,

- There is often compensation for changes in one ability for another.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YObG1dY.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Ability Changes over time:</mark>

Most people have enough abilities in reserve to adapt to changes and environmental restrictions as they get older.

There is some interaction between abilities as systems. (I.E. ability, when seen as systematic, can be matched to a task.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Qpijel0.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Classification of Abilities:</mark>

The WHO (World Health Organisation) has the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICIDH-2). Their document quotes; “As a classification, ICIDH-2 systematically groups different domains for a person in a given health condition (E.G. what a person with a disease or disorder does do or can do). Functioning refers to all body functions, activities and participation as an umbrella term; similarly, disability serves as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions.”

Geneva: World Health Organization (2000)

“ICIDH-2 organizes information in two parts: (1) Functioning and Disability, and (2) Contextual Factors. Each part has two components:

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">1. Components of Functioning and Disability:</mark>
- (a) The Body component comprises two classifications, one for functions of body systems, and one for the body structures. The chapters in both classifications are organized according to the body systems.
- (b) The Activities and Participation component covers the complete range of domains denoting aspects of functioning from both an individual and a societal perspective."

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">2. Contextual Factors:</mark>
- (a) A list of Environmental Factors forms part of the contextual factors. Environmental factors have an impact on all components of functioning and disability and are organized from the individual’s most immediate environment to the general environment.
- (b) Personal Factors are a component of contextual factors but are not classified in the ICIDH-2 because of the large social and cultural variance associated with them.”

The WHO ICIDH-2 gets to a description of computer use by ‘disabled’ users thus: “The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the Performance qualifier and the Capacity qualifier. The Performance qualifier describes what an individual does in his or her current environment... The Capacity qualifier describes an individual’s ability to execute a task or an action. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may reach in a given domain at a given moment...”

Other parts of the WHO document, related to computer accessibility:

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">“CONVERSATION AND USE OF COMMUNICATION DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES (d350-d369):</mark>
- d3601 Using writing machines using machines for writing, such as typewriters, computers and Braille writers, as a means of communication.”

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY</mark>
- e1251 Assistive products and technology for communication adapted or specially designed equipment, products and technologies that assist people to send and receive information, such as specialized vision devices, electro-optical devices, specialized writing devices, drawing or handwriting devices, signalling systems and special computer software and hardware, cochlear implants, hearing aids, FM auditory trainers, voice prostheses, communication boards, glasses and contact lenses.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Testing - Some Studies:</mark>

Effects of Age and Training on the World Wide Web (A study)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Navigation Strategies:</mark>
- Older users differed significantly from younger; they searched less efficiently,
- they had the most problems with tasks that required three or more moves,
- they had more difficulty recalling previous moves and the location of previously viewed information

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">More studies:</mark>

Usability and Accessibility of Aging/Health-Related Web Sites - compared usability (Bobby and LIFT) sites.
- The studies were maintained for the elderly by different organisations.
- US government sites were found to be best at less than 50% (failure, I believe).
- Designing a Touch Screen Kiosk for Older Adults was an example.
- User centered design recommended.

[The original <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Bobby</mark> was a free online tool used to validate websites for WAI and Section 508 compliance. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">LIFT</mark> is a software web analysis engine.]

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Age and Technology Observations:</mark>

Aging is a process of dynamic diversity,

Designing for the aging population requires designing for changing user characteristics,

Flexibility is the key

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction for Blind Computer Users:</mark>

An investigation into accessibility for unsighted users

"Contextualizing Accessibility: Interaction for Blind Computer Users" - Fredrik Winberg

Assistive interfaces as cooperative interfaces.

The ability of unsighted people to communicate with others, both individuals and groups of people, allows the development of a greater sense of community and social networks previously unavailable, which in turn supports overcoming social isolation.

Lack of training and accessible training materials, as well as general lack of access to a lot of information, still stands in the way of giving visually impaired people equal access as sighted people

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction for Blind Users - the problem:</mark>

To describe the present situation with the graphical user interface and the major accessibility problems it presents to a blind and visually impaired user, we can divide the problem into three major categories:
- difference in screen reading architecture,
- visual metaphors, and
- mouse-driven control and navigation.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Difference in screen reading architecture</mark>
- When using a text-based system, the information is displayed using plain text, which is easy to interpret by the screen reader and present using speech or Braille.
- However, graphical user interfaces are pixel-based, which means that information is stored and presented on the pixel level and could be very hard to translate to text. This makes it harder for the screen reader to get access and interpret the textual and especially the graphical non-textual information.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Visual metaphors:</mark>
- Instead of using a specialised command language and explicit information, the graphical interface presents information by using familiar objects or visual images. In order to identify an object or recognise an action, you have to actually see it, the possible textual information is often not enough, and the translation to alternative presentation modes is hard.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Mouse-driver control and Navigation:</mark>
- With no visual feedback, navigation with the mouse is hard since the hand/eye coordination that is essential in the use of the mouse does not translate well into speech synthesis or Braille text.
- There is simply no easy way to track the mouse cursor other than to look at the screen.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Screen Readers:</mark>
- Many blind and visually impaired people use a screen reader to access the contents of the computer screen. This is a piece of software that reads the contents of the screen and presents it using synthetic speech or Braille. For example, when browsing a desktop with files and folders, the user steps through the objects line by line, getting their names read out by a speech synthesiser or displayed on a Braille display. In order to access commands, menus and to make simple mouse emulation, the keyboard is used. The mouse is almost never used.

- The major difference between a screen reader and a graphical user interface is the way the information is presented. Plain text is a linear or one-dimensional way of presenting information, information that in the graphical user interface is two or three-dimensional.

- For example, in a desktop file system, like MacOS or Windows, the files and folders are placed on a two dimensional surface, and different windows could be placed on this surface also, both next to each other and partly or totally covering each other.

- When presenting this information using speech synthesis or Braille, this two or three-dimensional information is projected into one dimension. Important spatial information, such as grouping and spatial relationships, gets lost in this transfer when everything has to be presented in a linear fashion

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Screen Reader Problems (OSM)</mark>
- The Off-Screen Model (OSM)

- This is the data structure that the screen reader has to maintain, keeping all the information the screen contains.

- It contains information about what characters are written where on the screen, the different controls that are used and the grouping and the spatial relationship between the different objects.

- The problem with maintaining this model is that it could become outdated if the screen updates without updating the OSM

- Furthermore, the information in the OSM could be insufficient if the application uses non-standardised controls like a picture instead of a button, or presents text that is included in an image instead of using the built in functions in the operating system for writing text.

- In this case, there is no way for the screen reader to recognise that the image is a button or even a string of characters, and the user will miss it entirely.

- Even though the present development of accessibility in modern operating systems has made it easier for screen readers to access the screen contents, there are still problems in representing what is presented on the screen.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles of Universal Design:</mark>

The Seven Principles of Universal Design (to include less abled users)
1.  Equitable use
2. Flexibility in use
3. Simple and Intuitive
4. Perceptible Information
5. Tolerance for Error
6. Low Physical Effort
7. Size and Space (for approach and use

These seven principles may be applied to: evaluating existing designs, guiding the design process and educating both designers and consumers about the characteristics of more usable products and environments.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Beneficiaries of universal design include:</mark>
- People in a noisy shopping mall who cannot hear a kiosk,
- People who are driving their car who must operate their radio or phone without looking at it,
- People who do not have their glasses with them,
- People who are getting older,
- People with disabilities,
- Almost anyone.
