### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is a storyboard?</mark>

A storyboard is the product of the action of "storyboarding"

Storyboarding is a way to visualise something where there is an activity or many activities ("Think user doing work with a computer system")

A storyboard is usually a series of drawings accompanied by a short textual description, where each drawing details a particular point of interest

A storyboard could be described as a graphic organiser that allows you to plan a narrative or, for instance, a writing objective

Special software can be used to create good storyboards

The linear direction of the cells (individual pictures) is perfect for storytelling, explaining a <mark style="background:#BABD00;">process</mark> and showing a <mark style="background:#BABD00;">passage of time</mark>

During the storyboarding process, you can demonstrate the ideas you want to put across to your audience

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Where did storyboarding come from?</mark>

Storyboarding is associated with film and television industries, where storyboards were used as prompts for the plot development of films and TV programmes

It is attributed, by some, to Disney and the animation film people of Walt Disney's company in the 1930s

It has been used by media companies for many years

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Storyboards - Before and After:</mark>

Storyboards can be used to depict a situation "as is" followed by a depiction of the version "To be"

In other words, you could depict a computer system interface as users see it now, followed by a storyboard showing how it could work after a redesign of the interface

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping:</mark>

Prototyping involves producing an early, inexpensive and scaled down version of a product in order to reveal any problems with the current design

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Example:</mark> A version of software with an interface where the prototype shows stakeholders the interface design before it gets fully coded

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping can be:</mark>
- A series of screen sections
- A storyboard, i.e., a cartoon-like series of scenes
- A cardboard mock-up
- A digital mock-up (possibly interactive)
- A piece of software with limited functionality written in the target language or in another language

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis:</mark>

Task analysis has been described as a "Study of what an operator (or team of operators) is required to do, in terms of actions and/or cognitive processes, to achieve a system goal"

Task Analysis is the <mark style="background:#BABD00;">process of learning</mark> about ordinary users by observing them in action to understand in detail how they perform their tasks and achieve their intended goals

Tasks analysis help <mark style="background:#BABD00;">identify</mark> the tasks that websites and/or applications must support and can also help a developer refine or re-define a website's navigation (or search) by determining the appropriate <mark style="background:#BABD00;">content scope</mark>, or visual <mark style="background:#BABD00;">features</mark> of a software application

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis - its purpose:</mark>

What are your user's goals? What are they trying to achieve?

What users actually do to achieve those goals

What experiences (personal, social, and cultural) users bring to the tasks

How users' previous knowledge and experience influence:
- How they think about their work
- The workflow they follow to perform their tasks

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis - When?</mark>

It is important to perform a task analysis early in the systems development process, in particular, prior to design work.

Task analysis helps support several other aspects of the user-centred design process, including (in a website example):
- Website requirements gathering
- Developing a content strategy and site structure
- Wireframing and prototyping
- Performing usability testing

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Types of task analysis:</mark>

There are several types of task analysis but among the most common techniques used are:

Cognitive Task Analysis, which is focused on understanding tasks that require decision-making, problem-solving, memory, attention and judgement

Hierarchical Task Analysis, which is focused on decomposing a high-level task into subtasks

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis for Fact-Finding:</mark>

Task analysis is used mainly to investigate an existing situation
- It is important not to focus on superficial activities
- What are people trying to achieve?
- Why are they trying to achieve it?
- How are they going about it?

There are many techniques, the most popular is Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Hierarchical task analysis (HTA):</mark>

HTA involves breaking a task down into subtasks, then sub-sub-tasks and so on

These are grouped as plans which specify how the tasks might might performed in practice

HTA focuses on physical and observable actions and includes looking at actions not related to software or an interaction device

Start with a user goal which is examined and the main tasks for achieving it are identified

Tasks are divided into sub-sub tasks

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">HTA Example:</mark>

In order to buy a DVD:
1.  locate DVD
2. add DVD to shopping basket
3. enter payment details
4. complete address
5. confirm order

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis - A Summary Account:</mark>

Task analysis is a method of <mark style="background:#BABD00;">observing participants in action</mark> performing their tasks. Task analysis helps in figuring out how users perform tasks and how a system, product or service should be designed for users <mark style="background:#BABD00;">so that they can achieve their intended goals</mark>

Task Analysis also helps determine what user goals are: what designers might ask for, asking; how do users determine or measure the completion of tasks, what sort of personal, social as well as cultural attributes influence the user's performance, etc.
