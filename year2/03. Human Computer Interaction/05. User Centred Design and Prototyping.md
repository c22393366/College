### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction Design:</mark>

Interactive products in everyday use support people in their everyday and working lives

Examples include mobile phones, computers, ATMs, washing machines and smart televisions

Are they easy, effortless and enjoyable to use?

Interaction design involves taking into account a number of independent factors, including use of context, type of task and the type or kind of user

As a designer, you need to strive for usability and establish user experience goals

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The interaction design process:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/8eLDznd.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User's involvement in Design:</mark>

- Know your user
- Personae
- Cultural investigation

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is user-centred design?</mark>

It is an approach to interactive system development that focuses specifically on making technical products/web interfaces usable

The quality of interaction between the person who uses the products to achieve actual work, the product itself, is the primary goal of user-centred design

User-centred systems empower users and motivate them to learn and explore new system solutions

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Benefits of User-centred Design:</mark>

Understand how to design interactive products that fit with what people want, need and may desire

Appreciate that one size does not fit all, e.g. teenagers are very different to grown ups

Identify any incorrect assumptions they may have about particular user groups e.g. not all older people want or need big fonts

Gives awareness of both people's sensitivities and their capabilities

Gives realistic expectations ⇒ fewer surprises, less disappointment

Timely training may be organised

Makes the users active stakeholders

Users more likely to forgive or accept problems

Can make a big difference to acceptance and success of product

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles of User-centred design:</mark>

Active involvement of users

Appropriate allocation of function between the user and system

Iteration of design solutions

Multidisciplinary design teams

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Essential Activities in UCD:</mark>

Understand and specify the context of use

Specify the user requirements, and organisational requirements

Produce design solutions

Evaluate designs with users against requirements

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction Design - Four Activities:</mark>

1. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Identifying</mark> needs and establishing requirements
2. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Developing</mark> alternative designs
3. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Building</mark> interactive versions of the designs
4. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluating</mark> Designs

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The User -Centred Design Project:</mark>

Project planning has to allow for iteration and for incorporating user feedback.

More time will also be required for effective communication between design team participants and for reconciling potential conflicts and trade-offs.

However, project managers will benefit from the additional creativity and ideas from an extended development team and skill base.

Users will also feel a strong sense of ownership of the system that results.

Above all, proper consideration of usage issues early on in the project will result in a better design and significant savings at later stages when changes are much more costly.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Iterative Design using Prototyping:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/51R1sR4.png)

Generate a prototype of the Design e.g. initial design from guidelines and principles

Evaluate the design; Redesign to correct any errors; Build a new prototype

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototypes:</mark>

In other fields, a prototype is a small-scale model:
- A miniature care
- A miniature building or town

"Users can't tell you what they want, but when they see something and use it, they soon know what they don't want" (Preece)

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">prototype</mark> is an invaluable design tool for testing ideas, clarifying requirements and initiating user input and feedback

Prototyping is a core component of <mark style="background:#BABD00;">iterative design</mark> of information systems

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is a Prototype?</mark>

In HCI design it can be:
- A series of screen sketches
- A storyboard, i.e. a cartoon-like series of scenes
- A PowerPoint slide show
- A video simulating the use of a system
- A lump of wood
- A cardboard mock-up
- A piece of software with limited functionality, written in the target software language or another language

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What to Prototype?</mark>

Prototyping reduces uncertainty
- It can be a major tool for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">risk management</mark>
- Apply it to whatever you might be uncertain about

Prototyping technical issues
- E.g. runtime issues

Prototyping to establish requirements:
- Users "see" functionality

Prototyping for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">usability</mark> concerns

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Things to consider for prototyping:</mark>
- Technical Issues
- Work flow, task design
- Screen layouts and information display
- Difficult, controversial or critical areas of systems design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Types of Prototypes:</mark>

"Fidelity" refers to the <mark style="background:#BABD00;">level of detail</mark>, and much the prototype matches the finished article:
- Low Fidelity
- Medium Fidelity
- High Fidelity

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Low Fidelity Prototypes:</mark>

"Low fidelity" Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium, e.g. paper, cardboard, etc.

It is quick, cheap and easily changed

Examples:
- Sketches of screens
- Task sequences, etc.
- Post-it
- Storyboards
- 'Wizard-of-Oz'

A lo-fi prototype does not look very much like the final product. Material, behaviour etc

Using materials such as paper and cardboard, rather than electronic screens, complex models and detailed code

It is simple, quick and cheap to produce and redesign. It encourages further exploration of alternative designs and ideas.

Lo-fidelity happens at an early stage of development ⇒ prototyping for the conceptual design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Storyboards (as of last week):</mark>

Storyboards are a lo-fi visual representation where steps or actions are represented by panels, like a comic book

Goals are to:
- Flesh out the scenarios in an interaction design 
- Effectively communicate with users or stakeholders

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Sketching:</mark>

Sketching is important to low-fidelity prototyping

You need not be inhibited in your drawing ability. Practice simple symbols. Draw stick people.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Using office supplies:</mark>

Index cards, Post-it notes
- These can represent one page, or one screen
- They can be colour-coded
- Draw on them
- Group them
- Put them on a wall or whiteboard, connect them with string or lines
- Use "write on" tape, clear film, etc.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Wizard of Oz Prototyping:</mark>

With this, the user thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a developer is responding to output rather than the system

![](https://i.imgur.com/df96Tqe.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Medium Fidelity Prototypes:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping with a computer:</mark>
- Simulating some, but not all, features of the interface
- This can be engaging for end users

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Purpose:</mark>
- Provides sophisticated, but limited, scenarios for the user to try
- You can test more subtle design issues

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Dangers:</mark>
- User's reactions are often "in the small"
- Users are often reluctant to challenge the designer
- Users are often reluctant to challenge the design
- Management may think it is real

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">High Fidelity Prototypes:</mark>

Hi-fi prototypes use materials that you would expect to be in the final product

The prototype looks much more like the final system than a lo-fi version

Looks very much like the final product

If the prototype is for the software system, a software tool, such as macromedia Director or Blender, Visual Studio or Smalltalk might be needed

Software prototype tools are also often qualified development environments

More time-consuming to produce than lo-fi prototypes

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Benefits:</mark>
- They are the most realistic prototype
- They are closer to the final product
- You can collect metrics at this point

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Limitations:</mark>
- More expensive, less rapid than low or medium fidelity prototypes
- Users might show a reluctance to change when prepared

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping Methods:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Requirements Animation</mark> – functional requirements are demonstrated in a s/w prototype.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Throw-Away prototyping</mark> – similar to requirements animation... and prototype is not developed into the final product.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evolutionary prototyping</mark> – prototype is not discarded and is used as the basis for the next iteration of design. I.E. system “evolves” from prototype.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Incremental prototyping</mark> – final product is built as separate components, one at a time – allows large systems to be installed in phases to avoid delays between specification and delay

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping Specific Tools:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/j6p8RLz.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages and Disadvantages of Lo-Fi prototypes:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages:</mark>
- Lo-fi representations, such as sketches, differ from the final product in interaction design, visual appearance, and/or level of details. The method is quick and cheap, which encourages iterative design idea tryouts between/during usability tests
- Quick lo-fi tests allow designers and users to focus on high-level interaction design and information architecture, rather than on details or visual style

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>
- Users might judge a lo-fi prototype as unprofessional
- While lo-fi prototypes allow spontaneous changes for exploring interactions, they also sacrifice some realism
- Limitations in navigation and flow while a control person has to "make the interaction"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages and Disadvantages of Hi-Fi prototypes:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages:</mark>
- Hi-fi prototypes offer more realistic interactions than lo-fi
- Better at conveying the range of design possibilities
- User-driven

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>
- Hi-fi prototyping may make designers reluctant to change designs and less likely to fully explore the design space
- They take a long time to build and requires skill
- Reviewers and testers tend to comment on surface aspects rather than content

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability:</mark>

Usability is generally regarded as ensuring that interactive products are:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Easy</mark> to learn
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Effective</mark> to use
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Enjoyable</mark> from the user's perspective

Design for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">maximum usability</mark> is the goal of design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is usability?</mark>

Usability can be defined as:
- "The capacity to be used by humans easily and effectively where:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Easily:</mark> to a specified level of subjective assessment
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Effectively:</mark> to a specified level of human performance"
- Shackel, 1990

Usability <mark style="background:#BABD00;">affords</mark> the user easy access to a product's functions

![](https://i.imgur.com/SeRApWi.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Principles:</mark>

Jakob Nielsen defined <mark style="background:#BABD00;">10 usability principles</mark> that can be applied to any system, although frequently used for web application

They are used mainly as a basis for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">evaluating</mark> systems for usability

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics:</mark>

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards.
5. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
6. Error prevention
7. Recognition rather than recall
8. Flexibility and efficiency of use
9. Aesthetic and minimalist design
10. Help and documentation

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Nielsen's Heuristics:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">1)Visibility of System Status</mark>

- Always keep users informed about what is going on
