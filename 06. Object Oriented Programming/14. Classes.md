### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">What is a class?</mark>

```Python

class Student(object):
	"""Simple student class"""

def __init__(self, first="", last="", id=0, grade=0):  # initializer
   self.first_name_str = first
   self.last_name_str = last
   self.id_int = id
   self.grade = grade

def __str__(self):
	return "{} {}, ID:{}".format(self.first_name_str, self.last_name_str, self.id_int)

def print_grade(self):
   return "Grade is: {}".format(self.grade)

student1 = Student("Lucas", "Rizzo", 1, 100)

print(student1.print_grade())
```


<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Object Oriented Programming</mark> is a way to think about "objects" in a program (such as variables, functions, etc)

A program becomes less a list of instructions and more a set of objects and how they interact

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Responding to "messages":</mark>

As a set of interacting objects, each object responds to "messages" sent to it

The interaction of objects via messages makes a high level description of what the program is doing

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Everything in Python is an object:</mark>

As we said previously - everything in Python is an object

Thus Python embraces OOP at a fundamental level

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Type vs Class:</mark>

There is a strong similarity between a type and a python class

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Types</mark> includes list, dict, str

They are suitable for representing different data

Respond to different messages regarding the manipulation of that data

Python is fundamentally an OOP language

When we call a constructor such as list or str, we are making a new object

Those objects have attributes and respond to methods

We can sort a list by calling the method `my_list.sort()`, change a string to lowercase with the method `my_str.lower()`

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Encapsulation:</mark>

Hiding the details of the underlying data structures means that the changes can be made to the object, while the flow of messages (methods and their results) can stay the same

Thus the underlying implementation can change but its intended effect stay the same

This is known as <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">encapsulation</mark>

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">OOP principles:</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Encapsulation:</mark> hiding design details to make the program clearer and more easily modified later

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Modularity:</mark> the ability to make objects stand alone they can be reused

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Inheritance:</mark> create a new object by inheriting many object characteristics while creating or over-riding for this object

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Polymorphism:</mark> Allow one message to be sent to any object and have it respond appropriately based on the type of object it is (such as `count` and `len` functions

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Classes vs Instances:</mark>

You define a class as a way to generate new instances of that class

Both the instances and the classes are themselves objects

The structure of an instance starts out the same, as dictated by the class

The instances respond to the messages defined as part of the class

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Why a class?</mark>

We make classes because we need more complicated, user-defined data types to construct instances we can use

Each class has potentially two aspects:
- The <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">data </mark>that each instance might contain
- The <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">messages </mark>that each instance can respond


### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Our first class:</mark>

The standard way to name a class in Python is called <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">CamelCase</mark>:
- Each word of a class begins with a capital letter
- No underlines
- Makes recognising a class easier

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Constructor:</mark>

When a class is defined, a function is made with the <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">same name as the class</mark>

This function is called the <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">constructor</mark>. By calling it, you create an instance of the class

We can affect this creation, but by default Python can make an instance

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">dir() function:</mark>

The `dir` function lists all the attributes of a class

You can think of these as keys in a dictionary stored in the class

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">dot reference</mark>

We can refer to the attributes of an object by doing a dot reference of the form `obj.attribute`

The attribute can be a variable or a function

It is part of the object, either directly or by that object being part of a class

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">How to make an object-local value:</mark>

Once an object is made, the data is made the same way as in any other Python situation, by assignment

Any object can thus be augmented by adding a variable

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Class Instance Relationship:</mark>

Because each instance has as its type that it was made from, an instance remembers its class

This is often called the<mark style="background:#AD21D9;"> instance-of</mark> relationship stored in the <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">__class__</mark> attribute of the instance

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Object Scope Rule:</mark>

The first two rules in the object scope are:
1. First, look in the object itself
2. If the attribute is not found, look up to the class of the object and search for the attribute there

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Methods:</mark>

A method and a function are closely related. They are both "small programs" that have  parameters, perform some operation and potentially return a value

The main difference is that methods are functions tied to a particular object

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Difference in calling:</mark>

Functions are called by name anywhere in the program, methods are called in the context of an object:

```Python

function:
	do_something(param1)
method:
	obj.do_something(param1)
```

This means that the object that the method is called on is <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">always implicitly a parameter</mark>

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Difference in definition:</mark>

Methods are defined <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">inside </mark>the suite of a class

Methods always bind the first parameter in the definition to the object that called it

This parameter can be named anything, but traditionally it is named self


```Python
class MyClass(object):
	def my_method(self, param1):
		suite
```


`self` is an important variable. In any method it is bound to the object that called the method

Through `self` we can access the instance that called the method

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Self is bound for us:</mark>

When a dot method call is made, the object that called the method is <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">automatically </mark>assigned to `self`

We can use `self` to remember, and therefore refer, to the calling object

To reference any part of the calling object, we must always precede it with `self`

The method can be written genetically, dealing with calling objects through self
