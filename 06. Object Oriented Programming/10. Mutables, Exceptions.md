### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Assignment:</mark>

Assignment takes an object from the RHS and associates it with a variable on the LHS

When you assign one variable to another, you <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">share the association</mark> with the same object

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Immutable objects:</mark>

For immutable objects, object sharing is not a problem since the object cannot be changed.

Any changes that occur generate a <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">new</mark> object.

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Mutability:</mark>

If two variables associate with the same object then they <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">both reflect</mark> any change to that object.

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Copying:</mark>

If we copy, does this solve the problem? It depends

![](https://i.imgur.com/hCPrBT2.png)

What actually gets copied is the <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">top level reference</mark>. If the list has nested lists or uses other associations, the association gets copied. This is called a <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">shallow copy</mark>

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Shallow vs. Deep copies:</mark>

Regular copy, the [:] approach, only copies the top level reference. If you want a full copy you can use deepcopy

```Python
a_list = [1,2,3]
b_list = [5,6,7]
a_list.append(b_list)
a_list -> [1,2,3,[5,6,7]]

import copy 
c_list = copy.deepcopy(a_list)

b_list[0] = 1000

a_list -> [1,2,3, [1000, 6, 7]]
c_list -> [1,2,3, [5,6,7]] 
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">List Comprehension:</mark>

The use of lists in python is a major part of its power

Lists are very useful and can be used to accomplish many tasks

Therefore, python provides great support to make common list tasks easier

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Comprehension</mark> refers to constructing a new collection by performing some operation on the elements of another collection

```Python
expression for-clause condition
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Constructing lists using comprehension:</mark>

```Python
[n for n in range(1, 5)]
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/yAgl6jR.png)

[n**2 for n in range(1,6)]

this returns [1,4,9,16,25]

Note that we can only change the values we are iterating over, in this case n

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Multiple collects:</mark>

```Python
[x + y for x in range(1,4) for y in range(1,4)] 

#This is the same as: my_list = [] for x in range(1,4): for y in range(1,4): my_list.append(x + y) -> [2,3,4,3,4,5,4,5,6]
```

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Modifying what gets collected:</mark>

```Python
[c for c in "Hi There Mom" if c.isupper()]
```

The if part of the comprehensive controls of which the iterated values is collected at the end

Only those values which make the if part true will be collected

â‡’ ["H", "T", "M"]

```Python
[i for i in range(1,7) if i%2==0]
-> [2,4,6] 
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Tuples:</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Tuples</mark> are <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">immutable</mark> sequences

They are printed with (,) and similarly to lists, can have various lengths

```Python
>>> 10,12    # Python creates a tuple
(10, 12)
>>> tup = 2,3    # Assigning a tuple to a variable
>>> tup
(2, 3)
>>> (1)     # not a tuple, a grouping
1
>>> (1,)    # comma makes it a tuple
(1,)
>>> x,y = "a",3.14159    # multiple assignments
>>> x
'a'
>>> y
3.14159
>>> x,y    # create a tuple
('a', 3.14159)
>>> 
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Why do we need tuples?</mark>

The real question is, why have an immutable list as a separate type?

An immutable list give you a data structure with some integrity

You know you cannot accidentally change one

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Lists and Tuples:</mark>

Everything that works with a list also works with a tuple <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">except</mark> methods that <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">modify</mark> the tuple

Indexing, slicing, len and print all work as expected

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">None of the mutable methods</mark> work:
- ``append``
- ``extend``
- ``del``

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Commas make a tuple:</mark>

For tuples you can think of a comma as the operator that makes a tuple, where the () simple acts as a grouping:

```Python
myTuple = 1,2 #creates (1,2)
myTuple = (1,) #creates (1)
myTuple = (1) #creates 1, not (1)
myTuple = 1, #creates (1) 
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Data Structures in General:</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Organisation of data:</mark>
- Data Structures focus on the organisation of data and the operations we can perform on the data
- Different data structures will be suitable for solving different problems
- We have seen strings, lists and tuples so far

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Data structures: Efficiency:</mark>
- Efficient with respect to an <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">algorithm</mark>
- Efficient with respect to the amount of <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">memory</mark> space used
- Efficient with respect to the <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">time</mark> it takes to perform some operations

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Other Data Structures:</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Queue:</mark> a sequence of data elements that "stand in a line", in which the data can only be removed from the front of the line and new elements can only be added to the back of the line
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Operations:</mark> check to see if the queue is empty, add to the back and remove from the front

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Dictionary:</mark> a data structure is one in which we can look up a key and access some value
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Operations:</mark> look up a value associated with the key, add key value pairs, remove key-value pairs, etc

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Set:</mark> collection of unordered elements allows us to access and modify individual elements
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Operations:</mark> insertion, removal, union, intersection

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Matrix:</mark> of numbers is a common mathematical data structure.
- <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Operations:</mark> multiplication, find determinant, invert, transpose

Some of these are built-in for python e.g. a dictionary and a set

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Summary:</mark>

Lists are mutable

Tuples are immutable

Lists and tuples are sequences

Lists allow assignment, tuples do not

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Standard operations:</mark>
- length function ``len(L)``
- membership ``in``
- max and min: ``max(L)`` and ``min(L)``

Tuples work the same with indexing and slicing
