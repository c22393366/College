### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Composition:</mark>

Composition is a concept that models a <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">has-a</mark> relationship.

It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types.

Composition enables the reuse of code without having to inherit.

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Example:</mark>

```Python

class Horse(object):

	def __init__(self, age=0, breed="", tail_length = 0, tail_braid=False):
		self.age = age
		self.breed = breed
		self.tail = Tail(tail_length, tail_braid)

	def __str__(self):
		return "Horse age is {}. The breed is {}. {}".format(str(self.age), self.breed, str(self.tail))

class Tail(object):
	def __init__(self, tail_length = 0, tail_braid=False):
	self.tail_length = tail_length
	self.tail_braid = tail_braid

	def __str__(self):
		return_str = "The tail is " + str(self.tail_length) + "m long. "
		
		if self.tail_braid:
			return_str += "It has a braid."
		else:
			return_str += "It does not have a braid."
		return return_str



appaloosa = Horse(5, "appaloosa", 0.8)
falabella = Horse(3, "falabella", 1.2, True)

print(appaloosa)
print(falabella)

#Output

#Horse age is 5. The breed is appaloosa. The tail #is 0.8m long. It does not have a braid.

#Horse age is 3. The breed is falabella. The tail #is 1.2m long. It has a braid.

	```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Aggregation:</mark>

<mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Aggregation </mark>is a weak form of composition.

The difference is that both objects are independent of each other.


```Python
class Horse(object):
	def __init__(self, age=0, breed="", tail):
		self.age = age
		self.breed = breed
		self.tail = tail

def __str__(self):
	return "Horse age is {}. The breed is {}. {}".format(str(self.age), self.breed, str(self.tail))
```

The `Tail` class is still the same


```Python

class Tail(object):
	def __init__(self, tail_length = 0, tail_braid=False):
		self.tail_length = tail_length
		self.tail_braid = tail_braid

	def __str__(self):
		return_str = "The tail is " + str(self.tail_length) + "m long. "

	if self.tail_braid:
		return_str += "It has a braid."
	else:
		return_str += "It does not have a braid."

return return_str
```


But the Tail instances are now created in the main, and passed to the Horse constructor. The output is the same Â 

```Python
tail_appaloosa = Tail(0.8)
tail_falabella = Tail(1.2, True)

appaloosa = Horse(5, "appaloosa", 0.8)
falabella = Horse(3, "falabella", 1.2, True)

print(appaloosa)
print(falabella)
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Composition vs. Aggregation:</mark>

Which one was better? Depends on the problem.

When using composition, if you delete the horse you also delete the tail.

When using aggregation, if you delete the horse, the tail continues to exist.

In this case it is probably better to delete the tail with the horse.
