### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">If Statement:</mark>

```Python
if boolean_expression: 
	suite
```


### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">If-Elif-Else Statement:</mark>

```Python
if boolean_expression:
    suite1
elif boolean_expression2:
    suite2
# . . . (as many elifs as you want)
else:
    suite_last 
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Example:</mark>

```Python
grade = float(input("please enter your grade")

if 90 <= grade < 100:
    print("H1")
elif 40 <= grade < 90:

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">While-Else loop:</mark>

While loops can also have associated else statements

``else`` is executed when the loop finishes under normal conditions

```Python
while boolean_expression:
    suite
    suite
else:
    suite
    suite 
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Break statement:</mark>

A break statement in a loop, if executed, exits the loop

It exists immediately, skipping whatever remains of the loop, as well as the ``else`` statement (if it exists) of the loop

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">Continue Statement:</mark>

A continue statement, if executed in a loop, means to immediately jump back to the top of the loop and re-evaluate the condition

Any remaining parts of the loop are skipped for the one iteration when the text was executed

```Python
sum = 0
while True:
   number_str = input("Please enter a number: ")

   if number_str == ".":
       print ("Final sum is: ", sum)
       break

   number = int(number_str)

   if number % 2 == 0:
       sum += number
       continue
   
   print ("Number is not even! Enter even numbers only.")
```

### <mark style="background:#AD21D9;">For loop:</mark>

```Python
my_str = "abc"

for char in my_str:
    print(char)
```

The loop prints each character in a string in order and ends when it reaches the end of the string
