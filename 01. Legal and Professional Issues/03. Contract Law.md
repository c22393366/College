    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Carlil v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893):</mark>

        - The Carbolic Smoke Ball Company manufactured a patent medicine which was advertised as being able to prevent flu, among other ailments.

The fact that the company had deposited money in a special account was seen as proof of legal intent.

            - The buyers placed an order for the machinery on their own form, which did not allow for a price variation.

            - The sellers then returned the portion of the buyers' form that stated that the contract took place on the buyers' conditions.

            - The court held that the sellers' quotation was an offer, and the buyers' response was a counteroffer. The sellers accepted the counteroffer when they returned the slip accepting the buyers' conditions.

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Classification of terms:</mark>

    - A term can be either a condition, warranty or innominate term. Each provides remedies for an aggrieved party in the event of a failure of one party to fulfill their obligations of the contract, although the extent of the remedies vary upon the type contractual term.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Condition:</mark>

        - A condition is essentially the basis for a contract. It provides for the obligations of each party to an agreement.

        - The simplest way to think of a condition in contract law is found in the terms "If . . . then". "If" one party fulfils an obligation as contained in the agreement, "then" the other party to the agreement must fulfil their obligation to that party.

        - E.g. a condition in a contract for a sale of goods might include the terms that the successful completion of a contract relies upon an agreed upon delivery date of the goods. In order to fulfill the terms of that contract, the seller will only receive compensation for their goods if the buyer receives those goods by that set date.

        - If the seller should fail to meet that deadline, then the seller can be held in breach of the contract. The injured party can treat this failure of the seller to meet their obligations as "repudiatory", meaning the injured party has two options:

            - Terminate the contract (acceptance of the repudiation) and walk away from any obligation they may owe the seller: or

            - Treat the contract as continuing (affirm action of the contract)

        - It's important to note that in either case, the injured party can sue for damages, no matter the

        - reason for the breach or how little the loss to the party may be.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Warranty:</mark>

        - A term in a contract that is more like a promise by one party. A major difference from a condition is that if a party fails to live up to a warranty, the aggrieved party can sue for damages, but the failure does not provide cause for termination of the contract.

        - If the other party considers the warranty by one party important enough, then it could be classified as a condition. Generally, however, a warranty is usually only a statement of facts.

        - They can be expressed or implied and can exist for the lifetime of the contract or be contractual only for a limited time.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Innominate term:</mark>

        - A term that cannot be defined as either a condition or warranty. In the case where a party seeks recourse for a failure of the other party to fulfill the obligations of innominate term, it will be up to the courts to determine a remedy.

        - If the court determines that a breach has occurred, the remedy for the breach will depend on how the injured party is affected at the time the breach happens.

        - If the breach is deemed substantial, then the innominate term will be viewed more like a condition, and in addition to claiming damages, the injured party may terminate the contract. If the court views the breach to be more in line with a failure to fulfill a warranty, the injured party may claim damages, but does not have the ability to terminate the contract.
