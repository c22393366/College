### <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Priority Queue:</mark>

- A <mark style="background:#BD6500;">priority queue</mark> is a queue where each element has a priority and the element with the highest priority is at the front of the queue and will be the first element to be removed. To be contrasted with the <mark style="background:#BD6500;">stack</mark> and <mark style="background:#BD6500;">queue</mark> data structures which use <mark style="background:#BD6500;">LIFO</mark> and <mark style="background:#BD6500;">FIFO</mark> respectively

- It can be implemented as an unsorted array or a fully sorted array. Complexities are:

- So either one has no particular advantage, still get an O(n) operation, i.e. an operation which requires n steps

### <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Binary Tree:</mark>

- A <mark style="background:#BD6500;">binary tree</mark> is a recursive structure where each tree node may have 2 child nodes (or left and right subtrees)

- A <mark style="background:#BD6500;">complete binary tree</mark> is a binary tree where new nodes are added from left to right on the same level and a new level is only added when the current level is full. There are no 'gaps' anywhere in the tree between the first and last nodes

### <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Heap:</mark>

- A <mark style="background:#BD6500;">heap</mark> is another way to implement a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">priority queue</mark>. It has the logical structure of a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap condition

- A <mark style="background:#BD6500;">heap</mark> can be implemented using pointers (each node has 3 pointers - parent, left child and right child) or much more simply using a partially ordered array. In the array implementation where the highest priority key is in array position 1 we have:

```Java
parent(i) = i/2
lchild(i) = 2i 
rchild(i) = 2i + 1
```

- Here, ``parent(i)`` is the array index of the parent of node i

- A heap is <mark style="background:#BD6500;">partially ordered</mark> by satisfying the heap condition

- A fully sorted or ordered array could be used, but this would require more computation to maintain. Heaps make for much more efficient implementation of a priority queue. We will see later that:

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Heap Condition:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Heap condition:</mark> the priority of any node is greater than or equal to that of its left child and right child if it has such child nodes

- <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Example:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Inserting node with key P into the heap:</mark>

- P is added at the bottom right of the tree and sifted up to the correct position

- Finally you end up with:

- From the point of view of implementing this operation, it is helpful to consider the sift ups from an array perspective

- <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Removing largest value X from top of heap:</mark>

    - X is removed and the last value M in the heap is then moved to the top of the heap and <mark style="background:#BD6500;">sifted down</mark>

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/2t81Sq2.png)


    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/HTWAqRx.png)


    - Finally, M finds the right heap node to stay in

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Heap Operations in Pseudocode:</mark>

```Java
Key // a type, usually int, describes type of values in heap
int N // number of elements in array or heap
Key a[ ] // heap array of size N containing items of type Key.
The heap array a[] and N will be encapsulated inside the heap object.

insert(Key x)
    a[++N] = x
    siftUp( N)

// siftUp from position k. The key or node value at position k
// may be greater that that of its parent at k/2
// k is a position in the heap array h

siftUp( int k)
    v := a[k]
    a[0] := ∞
    while( v > a[k/2] )
        a[k] := a[k/2]
        k := k/2
    a[k] := v

// Key of node at position k may be less than that of its
// children and may need to be moved down some levels
// k is a position in the heap array h

siftDown(int k)
    v := a[k]
    while( 2k ≤ N ) // while node at pos k has a left child node
    j = 2k
    if( j < N  a[j] < a[j+1])
    ++j
    
    if( v  a[j] ) break
        a[k] = a[j]
        k := j
        a[k] := v

Key remove( )
    a[0] := a[1]
    a[1] := a[N--]
    siftDown( 1)
    return a[0]
```

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">HeapSort Java:</mark>

```Java
class HeapSort {

// used to reform the shrinking heap when
// the largest value is removed.
// N = heap size, a[N-1] is last value on heap
public  static void siftDown( int a[], int k, int n) {
   int v, j;

   v = a[k];
   j = 2*k+1;          // j is position of leftchild of k
   while( j <= n-1) {  // make sure leftchild of k is within the heap
      if(j < n-1 && a[j] < a[j+1]) 
            ++j;
      if( v >= a[j]) 
            break;
      a[k] = a[j];
      k = j;
      j = 2*k + 1;      
   }
   a[k] = v;
}


// in this version, it is assumed the array
// values are a[0] to a[n-1]. Then
// leftChild(k) = 2k+1, nrightChild(k) = 2k + 2
// parent(k) = (k-1)/2

public static void heapSort(int a[], int n)
{
   int k, v;

  // first convert array into heap
   for(k = (n-2)/2; k >= 0; --k)  // parent of last leaf  a[n-1]
      siftDown(a, k, n);     // is at (n-1-1)/2 = n/2 -1

   // repeatedly remove largest value from heap,
   // place in position freed by heap.
   for(k = n-1; k > 0; --k) {
      v = a[0];
      a[0] = a[k];
      siftDown( a, 0, k); // k new heap size
      a[k] = v;
   }
}




public static void main(String arg[])
{
    int a[];
    int N = 10;
    a = new int[N];

    int i;

    // insert 10 random number between 0 and 99 into array
    for(i = 0; i < N; ++i)
       a[i] = (int) (Math.random()*100.0);

    System.out.println( "\nUnsorted array is:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        System.out.print("  "  + a[i]);

    HeapSort.heapSort( a, N);

    System.out.println( "\nSorted array is:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        System.out.print("  "  + a[i]);
}
