#Algo 
- Consider the following <mark style="background:#BD6500;">weighted undirected</mark> (or bidirectional) <mark style="background:#BD6500;">graph</mark>. It could represent a number of different problems such as length or cost of optical fibre between network points, road distances between villages

- In Computer Science there are many useful <mark style="background:#BD6500;">algorithms</mark> that operate on a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">graph data structure</mark> such as:

    - Depth first traversal

    - Breadth first traversal

    - Shortest path tree (3 algorithms, Dijkstra)

    - Minimum spanning tree

    - Hamiltonian cycle

    - Eulerian cycle

- Before any of these are implemented, we first need to consider how a graph such as the one above might be <mark style="background:#BD6500;">stored</mark> or represented in computer <mark style="background:#BD6500;">memory</mark>. Also it makes sense to save it on <mark style="background:#BD6500;">secondary</mark> storage as a text file such as:

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/IiR3JmQ.png)


- Here, the first row tells us there are 7 vertices and 11 edges. Second row says there is an edge from A to B with weight 7 and vice versa. Third row edge from A to D weight 5 etc

- The simplest way to store this graph in primary memory is to use a 2-D array called an adjacency matrix. We say "adjacency" because it records which vertex is next to or connected to any other vertex

  

### <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Adjacency Matrix:</mark>

- If we use the graph as array indices and call the matrix ``adj[,]`` (or ``adj[][]`` if using Java to style 2D arrays then:

- ``adj[u, v]`` represents the weight of the edge between vertices ``u`` and ``v`` . For example, adj[A,B] or adj[1,2] = 7 and adj[2,1] = 7 . If there is no edge we say adj[u, v] = 0

- Here, we have not shown all the matrix values. The complete matrix would be:

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ExLX1i6.png)


- You can see that for a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">sparse graph</mark> most of the 2-D array would be occupied by 0s. An <mark style="background:#BD6500;">adjacency matrix</mark> is extremely <mark style="background:#BD6500;">inefficient</mark> space-wise for a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">sparse graph</mark>, especially as <mark style="background:#BD6500;">V</mark> (number of vertices) increases

- For <mark style="background:#BD6500;">sparse graphs</mark>, a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">linked list</mark> approach would be a more efficient use of memory as linked list <mark style="background:#BD6500;">nodes</mark> would only be allocated for <mark style="background:#BD6500;">edges</mark> that <mark style="background:#BD6500;">exist</mark>

### <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Adjacency Lists:</mark>

- In this approach, every <mark style="background:#BD6500;">vertex</mark> has a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">linked list</mark> associated with it which only <mark style="background:#BD6500;">records</mark> those vertices <mark style="background:#BD6500;">connected</mark> to it with an edge. The edge <mark style="background:#BD6500;">weights</mark> are also recorded. So, in a bidirectional graph, each edge is represented by <mark style="background:#BD6500;">two linked list nodes</mark>.

- For example, a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">graph constructor</mark> using <mark style="background:#BD6500;">adjacency lists</mark> in the first edge from the above text file would have created an <mark style="background:#BD6500;">array</mark> of <mark style="background:#BD6500;">linked lists</mark> with the following logical structure:

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Cvksbps.png)


- And after reading 5 edges from the file:

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/t9RAOsr.png)


- On reading all 11 edges:

### <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Graph Traversal Example:</mark>

- Depth first (blue) and breadth first (red)

- Note that the order depends on how the graph is stored, an adjacency matrix may show a DF visiting sequence different to that of an adjacency lists representation

- In this example, we use the adjacency matrix to see which vertices each vertex is connected to

- Also, an extra "visited array" is necessary to prevent an algorithm from visiting a vertex more than once

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/B7pbdYn.png)


<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Graph Search or Traversal:</mark>

- A graph is a complex data structure and can be viewed as a collection on which it may be desirable to do a traversal and process each vertex or edge in some way (similar to the way a <mark style="background:#BD6500;">for loop</mark> can be used to traverse an array)

	- Depth first, may use a stack or recursion

	- Breadth first, uses a queue

	- Best first, uses a priority queue or heap

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Depth First Traversal:</mark>

- For a connected graph (no isolated nodes), the following algorithm will visit each vertex in depth first fashion. If the graph is disconnected, it will only traverse 1 component of the graph. It easily implemented using recursion. Alternatively, a stack may be used for iterative implementation

```Java
Graph :: DF (Vertex s):
    Begin
        id = 0
        for v = 1 to V
            visited[v] = 0
        dfVisit(0, s)
    End
    
Graph :: dfVisit( Vertex prev, Vertex v)
    Begin
        visited[v] = ++id
        print “Visited vertex “, v, “ along edge “, prev, “—“, v

        foreach vertex u  adj(v)
            if not visited[u]
                dfVisit(v, u)

    End 
```

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Cormen's Algorithm:</mark>

```Java
DFS(G)
    for each vertex u ∈ G.V
        u.color = white
        u.π = NIL
    
    time = 0
    
    for each vertex u ∈ G.V
        if u.color == WHITE
            DFS_Visit(G, u)
DFS_Visit(G, u)
    time = time + 1 //white vertex u has just been discovered
    u.d = time
    u.color = GRAY
    
    for each v ∈ G.adj[u] //explore edge (u, v)
        if v.colour == WHITE
            v.π = u
            DFS_Visit(G,v)
    
   u.colour = BLACK //blacken u, it is finished
   time = time + 1
   u.f = time  
```

- <mark style="background:#BD6500;">Breadth First Travel:</mark>

```Java
Graph :: BF( Vertex s)
Begin
    Queue q
	
    id = 0

    for v = 1 to V
	visited[v] = 0

    q.enQueue(s)

    while (not q.isEmpty())
	v = q.deQueue()
	if (not visited[v])
	    visited[v] = ++id
	    for each vertex u  adj(v)
	        if (not visited[u])
	            q.enQueue(u)
	    end for
	end if
    end while
End
```

```Java
Graph :: BF( Vertex s)
Begin
    Queue q
	
    id = 0

    for v = 1 to V
	visited[v] = 0

    q.enQueue(s)

    while (not q.isEmpty())
	v = q.deQueue()
	if (not visited[v])
	    visited[v] = ++id
	    for each vertex u  adj(v)
	        if (not visited[u])
	            q.enQueue(u)
	    end for
	end if
    end while
End
```

- Breadth First Traversal (BF) will give a shortest path spanning tree on an unweighted graph. In an unweighted graph, you can consider all edges to have an equal weight of 1. BF visits all the vertices on the same level before proceeding to a "deeper" level, so all vertices newly visited on a level will be the same distance from the starting vertex. Further, since BF proceeds level by level with distances of 0, 1, 2, etc, it will reach a vertex via the shortest path to that vertex.

- If there was another path which was shortest path to a vertex, then the vertex would also belong to another previous level closer to the starting vertex; which of course is a contradiction since any level is exhausted before a deeper one is examined

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Best First Traversal:</mark>

- This approach attaches a value or priority to each vertex and for each iteration of the while loop, it 'visits' the vertex with the highest priority. The natural auxiliary data structure here is a heap. This method can be used in Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path algorithms

<mark style="background:#BD6500;">Iterative version of Depth First Traversal:</mark>

```Java
Graph :: DF_iter( Vertex start)
Begin
    Stack s
    id = 0
    
    for v = 1 to V
        visited[v] = 0
    
    s.push(start)
    
    while (not s.isEmpty())
        v = s.pop()
        
        if (not visited[v])
            visited[v] = ++id
            
            for each vertex u  adj(v)
                if (not visited[u])
                    s.push(u)

    end while
End
```
