#Algo 

- This follows the divide and conquer approach in contrast to quick sort which is more akin to conquer and divide. Merge sort divides the array and does the work of recombining (conquering) the subparts afterwards whereas quick sort does the work of partitioning (conquering) first and then divides into 2 smaller quick sorts..

### <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Pseudocode:</mark>
```Java
// a is an array of size n
mergeSort( a, n)
	int * b := new int[n]
	mSort( a, b, 0, n-1)

// a and b are arrays, l is left index, r is right index
mSort( a, b, l, r)
	if r > l
		m := (r + l) / 2
		mSort(a, b, l, m)
		mSort(a, b, m+1, r)
		// copy lhs subarray of a to b
		for i := m+1 to l+1
			b[i-1] := a[i-1]
		// copy rhs subarray of a to b in reverse order
		// b[r] := a[m+1] b[r-1] := a[m+2] ... b[m+1] := a[r]
		for j := m to r-1
			b[r+m-j] := a[j+1]
		// merge the 2 sorted subarrays in b into
		// one sorted array in a
		for k := l to r
			if b[i] < b[j]
				a[k] := b[i++ ]
			else
				a[k] := b[j--]

### <mark style="background: #BD6500;">Comment on Performance:</mark>

- Merge sort always takes 2N log<sub>2</sub> N steps. On average quick sort takes N log2 N steps. You would expect merge sort to be about twice as slow due to copying to ``b[]`` and back again to ``a[]``

- However, the performance of quick sort depends on a good choice of pivot. In our approach we choose the first element as the pivot. If an array is already nearly sorted, this can lead to very poor performance for quick sort. In its worst case quick sort requires N<sup>2</sup>/2 steps which is the same performance as bubble sort and selection sort.

- The main drawbacks of merge sort as opposed to quick sort are:
	- it requires an extra auxiliary array ``b[p]``
	- on average is about twice as slow
	
- However, in situations where the data can vary in how much it is already sorted, merge sort is more stable.
- In the above pseudocode description of merge sort, copying the rhs part of ``a[]`` into ``b[]`` in reverse order makes for a slightly more efficient algorithm. Why ?
