### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Extending the reach of LANs:</mark>

Where there is a need to <mark style="background:#69E772;">extend</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">interconnect</mark> LANs <mark style="background:#69E772;">three</mark> devices can be used:

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeaters:</mark>
- Used to interconnect identical LANs i.e. LANs using the <mark style="background:#69E772;">same</mark> MAC protocols (e.g. conforming to IEEE 802.3 or 802.5 etc.).
- Repeaters do <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> process frames.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Bridges:</mark>
- Used to interconnect LANs that use <mark style="background:#69E772;">similar</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">different</mark> MAC protocols (e.g. IEEE 802.3 and/or 802.5 etc.).
- Bridges <mark style="background:#69E772;">do</mark> process frames.
	
<mark style="background:#69E772;">Routers:</mark>
- Similar to bridges but with extra functionality i.e. used to interconnect <mark style="background:#69E772;">different</mark> LAN technologies. To be examined later under the topic <mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeaters:</mark>

Repeaters are used to overcome the distance limitation of LANs:

Recall that transmission signals attenuate over distance.

The length of a LAN segment is restricted to address attenuation e.g. a 10Base5 LAN has a length restriction of 500m.

When there is a need to interconnect stations beyond this distance, a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeater</mark> can be used.

A Repeater connects <mark style="background:#69E772;">segments</mark> of a LAN: It does <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> connect two LANs i.e. unique addressing is still required.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Basic functionality:</mark>
- Repeaters regenerate attenuated bits. For each bit received a fresh signal is reproduced.
- Repeaters forward every frame without filtering.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeater Implementation:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bridges:</mark>

Bridges facilitate the interconnection of <mark style="background:#69E772;">small</mark> LANs to create <mark style="background:#69E772;">one</mark> large LAN: This is preferable to creating a single large LAN.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages of using small interconnected LANs:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Reliability:</mark> The effects of a fault can be contained and restricted to only a few stations.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Performance:</mark> Smaller LANs provide better performance to <mark style="background:#69E772;">locally</mark> attached devices. This ties in with the <mark style="background:#69E772;">Principal of Locality of Reference</mark>:

The <mark style="background:#69E772;">majority</mark> of traffic is often between <mark style="background:#69E772;">locally</mark> connected stations

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Security:</mark> With some LAN topologies such as Bus and Wireless LANs <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> stations can potentially see <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> frames. The use of a Bridge facilitates the <mark style="background:#69E772;">physical</mark> isolation of high security traffic <mark style="background:#69E772;">and</mark> users with special security access.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Geography:</mark> It facilitates extending a LAN to isolated clusters of stations using long distance communications links e.g. microwave links, satellite links etc.

Bridges can interconnect more than 2 LANs.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bridge Implementation:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Functions of a bridge:</mark>

Basic Bridges only understand one frame format e.g. 802.3, 805.5 etc. These are sometimes called MAC Relay Bridges.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Store and Forward Functionality:</mark>

Operating in <mark style="background:#69E772;">promiscuous</mark> mode a Bridge reads all frames transmitted on one LAN.

It <mark style="background:#69E772;">retransmits</mark> frames to an outgoing port to which another LAN is connected only if the destination station is on that LAN.

The <mark style="background:#69E772;">retransmission</mark> is done <mark style="background:#69E772;">without modification</mark> to the frame i.e. <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit-by-bit</mark>.

This function is performed in <mark style="background:#69E772;">both</mark> directions.


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Routing and Addressing:</mark>

Not all frames are copied. Only those relevant to a particular LAN segment are copied. This implies a routing capability.

The use of a bridge does not affect how stations communicate with each other:

Unique MAC addresses are used for routing frames between stations connected to the same bridged network.

A routing strategy is used to decide which frames are forwarded onto another LAN.

There are two routing strategies to consider:
- Fixed routing.
- Address Learning

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Fixed Routing Strategy:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Fixed routing:</mark>

For each pair of source-destination station a route is created in a routing table stored on the bridge.

Based on the destination address in a received MAC frame the bridge performs a lookup of the routing table to determine if the frame is to be forwarded.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages/Disadvantages of fixed routing:</mark>

Simplicity. Requires minimal processing overhead. However, this can become very complicated if multiple bridges are used.

Requires a lot of manual intervention when more stations/bridges are added or removed.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Example Bridge Routing Table:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning Routing Strategy:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning</mark> is an alternative approach to routing. Here the Bridge can <mark style="background:#69E772;">learn</mark> the location of each station <mark style="background:#69E772;">automatically</mark> because:
- Each incoming MAC frame contains a <mark style="background:#69E772;">source address</mark> field.
- Each LAN attaches to one <mark style="background:#69E772;">port</mark> only.

Using both of these identifiers the bridge constructs <mark style="background:#69E772;">a routing table</mark> automatically i.e. without manual intervention

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Address learning starts at boot-up time:</mark>

Initially the routing table is empty.

As MAC frames arrive on any of the incoming ports the Bridge constructs the routing table using the source MAC address/source port information.

After a period of time known as the <mark style="background:#69E772;">steady-state</mark> period the table is complete: <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame filtering</mark> can commence in earnest.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning Process:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning Routing Strategy:</mark>

Bridges that use an address learning strategy are known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">Transparent Bridges</mark>:

Stations connected to the LAN are unaware of the existence of the bridge.

A problem with Transparent Bridges is <mark style="background:#69E772;">Looping</mark>:
- Arises from the use of <mark style="background:#69E772;">redundant bridges</mark>,
- Redundant bridges are often used for reliability in the event that one bridge fails; another bridge can take over.

Redundant bridges can create loops within the network as follows

![](https://i.imgur.com/C0q83ir.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Overcoming Bridging Loops:</mark>

Graph theory is used to create a loop-free bridge network:

A <mark style="background:#69E772;">Spanning Tree</mark> is a graph in which there is no loop.

To create a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Spanning Tree</mark> the network is represented as a graph:
- Here the graph <mark style="background:#69E772;">nodes</mark> represent the bridges and the LANs to which they connect,
- The connecting <mark style="background:#69E772;">arcs</mark> represent the connections between a LAN(s) and a bridge(s),
- Each arc is a assigned a <mark style="background:#69E772;">cost metric</mark> (‘1’ in the direction of a bridge to a LAN and, ‘0’ for the opposite direction)

An example bridged network:

![](https://i.imgur.com/3PEGQ8C.png)

Finding the Spanning Tree involves three steps:
- Identify the <mark style="background:#69E772;">Root Bridge</mark>. The bridge with the lowest value ID (usually the Bridge serial number) is designated the Root bridge,
- Find the <mark style="background:#69E772;">shortest path</mark> from the Root Bridge to every other bridge and LAN in the network,
- Eliminate redundant routes. The routes with the shortest paths become the spanning tree.

All bridge ports in the spanning tree are marked as <mark style="background:#69E772;">forwarding ports</mark>:

All other ports are marked as <mark style="background:#69E772;">blocking ports</mark>.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages of using Bridges:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Parallelism:</mark>
- Not every frame arriving at the bridge is copied to another LAN:
- This allows for two pairs of stations to communicate simultaneously provided each pair is on a separate LAN and separated by a bridge.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Optimised performance:</mark>
- Stations that are likely to communicate with each other frequently can be moved to the same LAN to ensure adherence to the Principal of Locality of Reference.
- Collision Domains are smaller, reducing the likelihood of collisions occurring

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Optimised performance and Parallelism:</mark>
![](https://i.imgur.com/4VKqfL1.png)


Without bridging each station perceives the speed of the LAN as:

(LAN Data Rate) / (number of stations).

This is significantly improved with bridging.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Collision Domains are reduced in size:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/9i8QjAH.png)


<mark style="background:#69E772;">With</mark> bridging the size of the collision domain is reduced and contention is therefore reduced.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Summary of Bridges:</mark>

Used to extend LANs creating small interconnected LANs rather than a single large LAN.

Can connect LANs with similar <mark style="background:#69E772;">or</mark> different MAC protocols.

Contains <mark style="background:#69E772;">Routing</mark> functionality to <mark style="background:#69E772;">filter</mark> frames:
- This facilitates parallelism which in turn improves performance of each connected LAN
- Also, collisions are not copied between LANs which reduces the Collision Domain and improves contention ratio.

Contains <mark style="background:#69E772;">Store</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Forward</mark> functionality:
- Facilitates connecting fast, busy LANs to slow LANs.
