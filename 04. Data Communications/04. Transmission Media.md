The Transmission Media is the path along which the signal travels

The type of medium determines the type of signal to be used and can affect the reliability of communications

  
### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Conventional networks use copper wire:</mark>

Low resistance to electrical current

The terms <mark style="background:#69E772;">copper</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">wire</mark> are used interchangeably

Prone to interference from other wires close-by

This interference can be minimised by using <mark style="background:#69E772;">Twisted Pair</mark> wiring and <mark style="background:#69E772;">co-axial</mark> cable

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">TP, Co-ax and Optical Fibre Cables:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Twisted Pair:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Comprised of 2 insulated copper wires twisted together
- These twists reduce cross talk
- Typically many pairs are bundled in a protective sheath
- Very cheap and easy to use
- BW: Cat 3 = 16MHz, Cat 5 = 100MHz, Cat 6 = 250MHz

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Applications:</mark>
- In office buildings for phone and computer connectivity
- Residential telephone - the local loop

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Coaxial Cable:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Comprised of central copper conductor and a hollow outer cylindrical conductor
- A surrounding sheath holds the inner conductors in place
- BW: 1GHz

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Applications:</mark>
- Cable TV
- Long distance telephone network
- Computer connectivity (LANs)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Optical Fibre:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Comprised of thin, flexible, transparent glass fibre core
- This core is surrounded by glass or plastic cladding with a lower refractive index
- Outer sheath provides rigidity and protection
- Several fibres may be bound in a single jacket


Two types of light source used:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Light Emitting Diode</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">LED</mark>) - low cost
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Injection Laser Diode</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">ILD</mark>) for higher data rates and greater distances

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Applications:</mark>
- Long distance telephone connections
- Metropolitan trunks
- Rural exchange trunks
- Local loop
- LANs

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Optical Fibre Vs Coaxial Cable:</mark>

Optical Fibre cables offer the following advantages over co-axial cables:
- Electromagnetic isolation i.e. no interference
- Lower attenuation, hence greater repeating spacing (50km vs 5km for copper)

Greater Capacity - up to 10 Gbps over many kms

Requires only single core for complete circuit, hence smaller in size, lighter in weight

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Wireless Transmission:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Two configurations:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Omni-directional</mark> e.g. radio station
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Directional</mark> e.g. microwave/satellite links

##### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Radio Transmission Characteristics:</mark>

Networks that use EM radio waves are known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">Radio Frequency</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">RF</mark>) networks

There is no physical connection between stations

Transmission is achieved using an antenna

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Terrestrial Microwave Characteristics:</mark>

Microwaves travel at higher frequency than RF. Typically 2-40 GHz

This higher frequency allows for a larger bandwidth which implies a high data rate e.g. 120 Mbps

Waves are focused into a narrow beam by a parabolic dish antenna

Waves are received by a similar dish antenna

Line of sight required (although not always possible)

Prone to interference from rainfall and other dishes

Prone to misalignment in storm

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Terrestrial Microwave Links:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Terrestrial Microwave Applications:</mark>

Back-to-back installations used on long haul links (this is their main application)

Also used where there are difficulties laying cables e.g. mountain top installations

Very common with mobile phone networks e.g. the 3 Network relies heavily on MW links

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Satellite Microwave (aka Satellites):</mark>

Satellites can link two or more ground stations i.e. they act as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">relay</mark>

Satellites use two different bands (frequency ranges) to communicate:
- Different frequencies allow full duplex comms
- There are <mark style="background:#69E772;">up</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">down</mark> links each using different frequencies

Two types of Satellite (<mark style="background:#69E772;">GEOs</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">LEOs</mark>):
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">GEOs</mark> remain stationary over a point on earth
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">LEOs</mark> move rapidly across the sky

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Satellites:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Originally operated in range 1-10GHz
- The 4/6 GHz is now saturated
- 12/14 GHz now open for service
- Inherent propagation delay, approx 0.25sec

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Applications:</mark>
- Television distribution,
- Long distance telephone transmission
- Private business networks

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Infrared:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Does not require antennae or special license to operate,
- Uses LED,
- Very low cost
- Cannot penetrate obstacles i.e. requires line of sight

##### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Applications:</mark>
- Remote controls,
- Computer-to-computer connectivity e.g. mobile phones

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bluetooth:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
- Uses the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Industrial, Scientific and medical)
- Uses low power which implies a short range (approx. 10m)
- Comprises 79 channels of 1 MHz each,
- Uses a type of encoding called FSK which provides for 1 bit per Hz i.e. 1 Mbps per channel

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Applications:</mark>
- Connections of a variety of computing devices
