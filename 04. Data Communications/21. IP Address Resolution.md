### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Binding Protocol Addresses</mark>

IP protocol software works with IP addresses when 
forwarding <mark style="background: #69E772;">packets</mark>:

The outcome of the routing process is the IP address of the <mark style="background: #69E772;">Next Hop</mark>.

The <mark style="background: #69E772;">Next Hop</mark> can be another router or, it can be the 
destination host residing on a <mark style="background: #69E772;">directly connected</mark> LAN.

Refer to examples given in class. 

Recall that IP addresses cannot be used when forwarding <mark style="background: #69E772;">frames</mark> across a <mark style="background: #69E772;">physical network</mark>: Only MAC addresses are relevant for this task.

Therefore the <mark style="background: #69E772;">Next Hop</mark> IP address must be translated to 
an equivalent <mark style="background: #69E772;">hardware/MAC</mark> address before the frame 
can be transmitted: This translation is known as <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution</mark>.

Once translated, the IP address is said to be resolved.

Address resolution is <mark style="background: #69E772;">local</mark> to a network.

Any host connected to a LAN can only resolve the IP 
addresses of other stations/routers connected to the 
same LAN:

Hosts A, B and router R1 can resolve each others IP 
addresses but, neither hosts A nor B can resolve Hosts C, 
D, E, F or router R2s’ IP addresses.

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution Techniques:</mark>

The algorithm used to translate a protocol address into a hardware address depends upon the protocol and hardware addressing schemes in use.

However, there are three categories of address resolution algorithms as follows:
- Table lookup
- Closed-form computation
- Message exchange

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution with Table Lookup:</mark>

Here an array is used to store information about 
address bindings.

The main advantages of the table lookup approach 
are:
- It can be used to store arbitrary address bindings. 
- A protocol address can be mapped to an arbitrary hardware address .
- It is straightforward and easy to program.

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution with Closed-Form Computation:</mark>

For <mark style="background: #69E772;">configurable MAC addressing</mark> it is possible to choose addresses that make <mark style="background: #69E772;">closed-form address resolution</mark> possible.

A <mark style="background: #69E772;">resolver</mark> computes the MAC address from the IP address using a mathematical function.

If the relationship is simplistic, the computation requires only a few arithmetic operations (e.g. a single Boolean
AND operation):

``hardware_address = ip_address AND Oxff``

Closed-form computation can be very efficient because both the <mark style="background: #69E772;">hardware</mark> and <mark style="background: #69E772;">IP addresses</mark> can be changed

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution with Message Exchange:</mark>

This is a <mark style="background: #69E772;">distributed</mark> approach to Address Resolution.

To resolve an address a station sends a message across a network and receives a reply.

There are two distributed designs to choose from:
- The network includes a server that is assigned the task of answering address resolution requests. The advantage of this scheme is that it is <mark style="background: #69E772;">centralised</mark>.
- Or, each computer on the network participates in address resolution by agreeing to answer resolution requests for its own address: The advantage of this scheme is that it is <mark style="background: #69E772;">distributed</mark>.

Fortunately the TCP/IP protocol suite defines a protocol for Distributed Address Resolution:
- This protocol is known as the <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution Protocol</mark> (<mark style="background: #69E772;">ARP</mark>).
- It specifies the exact format and meaning of messages used to resolve addresses

The protocol defines two messages used in the exchange:
- An ARP Request Message containing the IP address to be resolved.
- An ARP Reply Message containing the IP address and its  associated MAC address

<mark style="background: #69E772;">ARP Message Structure:</mark>

ARP request messages are <mark style="background: #69E772;">Broadcast</mark> to <mark style="background: #69E772;">all</mark> computers  on the network inside a <mark style="background: #69E772;">frame</mark>: 

The frame’s DEST MAC address is the network’s broadcast 
address.

The <mark style="background: #69E772;">ARP Request Message</mark> contains: SRC MAC/SRC IP Addresses and DEST MAC (unknown - all zeroes) and DEST IP Address (to be resolved).

<mark style="background: #69E772;">ARP response messages</mark> are not broadcast

The ARP <mark style="background: #69E772;">response message</mark> contains: SRC MAC (now resolved) and SRC IP Addresses and DEST MAC/DEST IP  Addresses. (Note the SRC and DEST addresses are switched)

### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):</mark>

Sending request messages for each binding is very inefficient.

Most computer communication involve the exchange of multiple packets. This is likely to require multiple binding requests.

To reduce network traffic, ARP software caches address bindings.

Both the sender and receiver cache address  bindings from the request/response messages.

The following outlines a number of scenarios 
which require <mark style="background: #69E772;">Address Resolution</mark>:
