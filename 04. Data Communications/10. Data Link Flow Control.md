So far we have explored the transmission of signals with encoded data over a <mark style="background:#69E772;">basic transmission link</mark>

For effective communications much more is needed to control and manage the exchange of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark>

A layer of control logic is required above the physical layer in each Source/Destination device:
- This logic is referred to as Data Link Control,
- When used, it transforms a basic Transmission link into a fully functioning <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data Communications Channel</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data Link Control:</mark>

This <mark style="background:#69E772;">logic</mark> is implemented as a set of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Rules</mark> which are well defined.

The definition of the logic/rules is known as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Protocol</mark>

Protocols are <mark style="background:#69E772;">synonymous</mark> with data communications
- They are often referred to in texts on the subject,
- The first protocol to be explored is the <mark style="background:#69E772;">data link protocol</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data Link Control Requirements:</mark>

There are six basic requirements for effective Data Link Control as follows:

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame Synchronisation:</mark> Frames must be recognisable by the Receiver

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Flow Control:</mark> The Sender must <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> overload the receiver

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Error Control:</mark> Errors should be detectable by the Receiver

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Addressing:</mark> For a multi-point configuration each station must be uniquely identifiable

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Control and Data on the Same Link:</mark> The receiver must not have to wait for control information to arrive before it can process a frame

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Link Management:</mark> Procedures for establishing and relinquishing the link must be adhered to

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Flow Control:</mark>

Receiver and buffer stations each allocate a data <mark style="background:#69E772;">buffer</mark> of a fixed size
- Data Remains in the buffer until it has been processed by the receiving station,
- Consequently the buffers can fill to capacity

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Flow control</mark> enables the Receiving station to indicate to the Sending station that its buffers are full

There are <mark style="background:#69E772;">two flow control</mark> techniques to consider:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Stop-and-wait</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Sliding Windows</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Stop-and-wait Flow Control:</mark>

Here the Sending station transmits a frame:
- The Sending station must get an <mark style="background:#69E772;">acknowledgement</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">ACK</mark>) from the Receiving station before transmitting the next frame,
- The Receiving station can control the flow of data by withholding <mark style="background:#69E772;">ACKs</mark>

This technique only allows for the transmission of a single frame in either direction i.e. Half-Duplex communications

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Sliding Window Flow Control:</mark>

Here both stations use an <mark style="background:#69E772;">extended</mark> buffer size to hold multiple frame

The Sending and Receiving stations maintain a list of frames already sent/received

This technique allows for <mark style="background:#69E772;">more efficient link utilisation</mark>:
- The transmission link is effectively treated as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">pipeline</mark> that can be <mark style="background:#69E772;">filled</mark> with many frames in transmit <mark style="background:#69E772;">simultaneously</mark>

This technique allows multiple frames to be in either direction i.e. Full Duplex communications

![](https://i.imgur.com/F9gvrnS.png)


In the example, Stations <mark style="background:#69E772;">A</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">B</mark> each <mark style="background:#69E772;">allocate</mark> buffer space for <mark style="background:#69E772;">W</mark> frames: I.E. Station B can accept W frames and Station A can send W frames without any acknowledgement being sent or received

Each frame contains a <mark style="background:#69E772;">sequence number</mark>

Station B sends <mark style="background:#69E772;">ACKs</mark> that include the sequence number of the <mark style="background:#69E772;">next</mark> frame expected: I.E. station B is prepared to receive <mark style="background:#69E772;">starting</mark> at the <mark style="background:#69E772;">sequence number</mark> indicated e.g. RR5

Multiple frames can be <mark style="background:#69E772;">ACK'd</mark> using a single <mark style="background:#69E772;">control message</mark>
- e.g. Receipt of ACK for frame <mark style="background:#69E772;">2</mark> (RR3) followed later by ACK for frame <mark style="background:#69E772;">5</mark> (RR6) implies acknowledgement of frames <mark style="background:#69E772;">3</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">4</mark>


Station A maintains a list of frame numbers it is allowed to send

Station B maintains a list of frame numbers it is prepared to receive

These lists can be considered as <mark style="background:#69E772;">windows</mark>


To impose flow control, the Receiver can send a different control message:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Receiver Not Ready</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">RNR</mark>)
- This acknowledges previous frames but stems the flow from the Sender e.g. RNR5 acknowledges all frames up to frame 4

To resume flow the Receiver sends a Receiver Ready (RR) message e.g. RR5 - recommence at frame 5


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Example Sliding Window:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/DmKsU8t.png)


In the previous example the operation of Sliding Windows can be clearly seen:
- Frames 0-2 are transmitted
- Copies of these frames are held in memory on both the Sender (Tx) and the Receiver (Rx) station until an ACK is returned
- When the Rx sends the ACK it removes the frames from memory and the Sliding Window expands
- When the Tx receives the ACK it removes the frames from memory and the Sliding Window expands

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Note on ACKs:</mark>

Here, an ACK is shown as a special message (RR3)

Both RR and RNR messages are positive ACKs. They are acknowledging that a successful transmission has occurred

Only one ACK is required for three frame. RR3 acknowledges all frame up to and including frame 2 i.e. 0, 1 and 2

This is one of the efficiencies of the technique. Recall that S-and-W required one ACK per transmission

This approach to sending one ACK for multiple frames allow for <mark style="background:#69E772;">Full Duplex</mark> communications: ACKs can be returned anytime i.e. after receipt of a single frame or multiple frames

This Full Duplex mode can be seen in the later transmission of Frames 3-6: Frame 3 has arrived and an ACK (RR4) is immediately returned. The ACK can be clearly seen in transit at the same time as Frames 4, 5 and 6 are arriving

The consequence of this is that Frame 3 is held in memory very briefly and then it is removed. This is too quick for it to be seen stored in memory

Frames 4, 5 and 6 arrive soon after Frame 3: these frames can be clearly seen stored in memory

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Question:</mark> Assuming Frames 4, 5 and 6 arrive without incident, what would the next positive ACK be?

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Answer:</mark> The next positive ACK could potentially be one of two messages depending on the status of the Rx buffers:
- If, upon receipt of Frame 6, the Rx buffers become full then it could be RNR7. This message would acknowledge receipt of all frames up to and including Frame 6 but it would also instruct the Tx to stop sending frames
- If, upon receipt of Frame 6, there is still space in the Rx buffers, then it would be RR7. Once again this message would acknowledge receipt of all frames up to and including Frame 6 but it would also permit the Tx to <mark style="background:#69E772;">continue</mark> sending frames

With the introduction of Full Duplex mode each station can be a Tx'er or Rx'er

Full Duplex mode allows for frames to be in transit between the stations <mark style="background:#69E772;">simultaneously</mark> and in <mark style="background:#69E772;">opposite</mark> directions. This includes <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> frames

With the capability to transmit Data frames in opposite directions, it is possible to introduce another efficiency.

ACKs don't have to be sent as separate frames


Instead, ACKs can be included in outgoing <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> frames
- i.e. Data Frames moving in one direction can carry ACKs in their Control Fields for Data Frames moving in the opposite direction
- This technique is known as piggybacking i.e. a <mark style="background:#69E772;">single</mark> frame can carry both <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">ACKs</mark>

Consequently, in Full Duplex mode each station must maintain <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> sliding windows
- One for <mark style="background:#69E772;">Transmitted</mark> frames and one for <mark style="background:#69E772;">Received</mark> frames

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Sliding Window Versus Stop-and-Wait Flow Control:</mark>

Sliding Windows is potentially <mark style="background:#69E772;">more</mark> efficient than Stop-and-wait in relation to <mark style="background:#69E772;">Link Utilisation</mark>:
- With Stop-and-Wait only <mark style="background:#69E772;">one</mark> frame can be in transit at any time i.e. Half-Duplex communications
- With Sliding Window the link is treated like a pipeline that can be filled with multiple frames
- This allows for simultaneous two-way communications i.e. Full Duplex communications

Sliding Windows uses a special message, RNR, to impose Flow Control:
- This RNR message is a positive ACK which allows the Tx to clear frames from its outgoing buffer
- Recall that Stop-and-Wait simply with-held the ACK. The Tx must hold onto the frame until the ACK arrives
