Errors exist in <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> transmission systems:

Consequently, it is necessary to include some form of <mark style="background:#69E772;">error detection</mark>

Error detection capabilities allow the Receiver station to detect if any of the bits contained in a received frame have been modified

If they have, then something needs to be done about it. Typically this would involve a re-transmission of the errored frame

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">A general principle of error detection is:</mark>

All <mark style="background:#69E772;">frames</mark> include additional bits which constitute an error-detecting <mark style="background:#69E772;">code</mark>

The code is calculated using an algorithm that includes other bits within the frame

The receiver performs the same calculation

The presence of an error will cause a mismatch (although not always, some errors go undetected)


There are three common techniques to consider:
- Parity checking
- Checksums
- Cyclic Redundancy Check

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Parity Checking:</mark>

A bit is added to the end of <mark style="background:#69E772;">every</mark> character

This bit is called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">parity bit</mark>

The value of the bit is selected to make the total number of <mark style="background:#69E772;">one</mark> bits in the character <mark style="background:#69E772;">even</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">even parity</mark>) or <mark style="background:#69E772;">odd</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">odd parity</mark>)

The Receiver counts the number of bits received to verify the validity of the parity bit

Parity checking can detect single-bit errors, or, an <mark style="background:#69E772;">odd</mark> number of bit errors i.e. where 1, 3, 5 . . . etc. bits are in error

It cannot detect <mark style="background:#69E772;">double-bit</mark> errors or, where an <mark style="background:#69E772;">even</mark> number of bits are in error e.g. 2, 4, 6 . . .etc.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Checksums:</mark>

This mechanism operates at the <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame</mark> level (or as shall be shown later at the <mark style="background:#69E772;">packet</mark> level)

The transmitter treats the <mark style="background:#69E772;">entire</mark> frame as a sequence of binary integers and computes their numeric sum: <mark style="background:#69E772;">16</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">32</mark>-bit checksums can be used

Once again, not all errors can be detected

![](https://i.imgur.com/1A3GQaU.png)

In this example, a 16-bit checksum is being determined hence the result must be 16 bits long

The data is separated into 16-bit quantities and added together to give a result of <mark style="background:#69E772;">271FA</mark>

Note the <mark style="background:#69E772;">2</mark> on the LHS takes the result over <mark style="background:#69E772;">16-bits</mark> hence it is added back onto the <mark style="background:#69E772;">A</mark> to give a 16-bit result (<mark style="background:#69E772;">71FC</mark>)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):</mark>

This technique is more involved

Here the Transmitter adds a <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">sequence</mark> to <mark style="background:#69E772;">each</mark> frame i.e. not just a single bit nor an integer value as before

This bit sequence is known as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame Check Sequence</mark> (FCS)

The FCS is derived from the bits associated with the <mark style="background:#69E772;">message</mark> to be transmitted using a <mark style="background:#69E772;">predetermined</mark> number (the <mark style="background:#69E772;">P-value</mark>)

The Receiver divides <mark style="background:#69E772;">each</mark> incoming frame by the <mark style="background:#69E772;">same</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">predetermined</mark> number (divisor) and checks the remainder

If remainder is zero it assumes <mark style="background:#69E772;">no</mark> errors have occurred

(SKIPPED THE PROOF â‡’ NOT EXAMINABLE)

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Conclusion:</mark>
- What is required is an error detection code (called the GCS) such that received frame <mark style="background:#69E772;">T</mark> is exactly divisible by the (<mark style="background:#69E772;">P-value</mark>) in the absence of any errors i.e. T/P has no remainder
- Where <mark style="background:#69E772;">T</mark> (the transmitted/received frame) is the concatenation of the message and the n-bit <mark style="background:#69E772;">FCS</mark> i.e. T = M + FCS
- The <mark style="background:#69E772;">P-value</mark> is an (n+1 bit divisor) known to both the transmitter and the receiver and is always one bit longer than the <mark style="background:#69E772;">FCS</mark>.


From the above Proof such an FCS can be found from the <mark style="background:#69E772;">remainder</mark> of the calculation <mark style="background:#69E772;">(2^n(m))/P</mark>.
- All calculations are performed using modulo 2 arithmetic
- When this FCS is used T/P is guaranteed to result in a zero remainder when there are no errors

<mark style="background:#69E772;">CRC - Step Approach:</mark>
- To determine the FCS the Transmitter uses the <mark style="background:#69E772;">remainder</mark> from the following calculation: <mark style="background:#69E772;">(2^n(m))/P</mark>
- The FCS is included in the frame with the message M: i.e. FCS is concatenated onto M to give the new transmitted frame (T)
- The Receiver divides T by the P-value if <mark style="background:#69E772;">no remainder</mark> results it concludes that there are no errors

(SKIPPED MORE BECAUSE IT'S NON-EXAMINABLE)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Error Control:</mark>

Having examined the operation of three error detection techniques it is useful to explore how they are used

The Detection and Recovery from errors is known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">error control</mark>

To discuss Error Control the following assumptions are made:
- Data is sent as a sequence of <mark style="background:#69E772;">frames</mark>.
- Each time a frame is transmitted a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Timer</mark> is set to some value
- Frames must arrive in the order in which they were sent otherwise an error is assumed
- Each frame suffers an arbitrary, variable delay called propagation delay

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Two types of error can occur:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Lost frame/lost ACK:</mark> Either a Data frame or an <mark style="background:#69E772;">ACK</mark> is lost in transit. Recall the effects of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Impulse Noise</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Damaged frame:</mark> Here a frame arrives but it fails the error detection check

Error Control provides a number of techniques to address each of these types of error

These techniques can be considered a <mark style="background:#69E772;">tool-chest</mark>

Each technique can be considered a tool which can be applied when something goes wrong (or when everything is working fine)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Error Control - Elements:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Error Detection:</mark> Discussed previously e.g. CRC

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Positive ACK:</mark> Here the Receiver sends positive ACKs to error-free frames received (implicitly or explicitly)

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Retransmission:</mark> (after time-out). Here the transmitter may retransmit a frame that has not been acknowledged after a time-out period

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Negative Acknowledgement:</mark> Here the Receiver can send a negative ACK for damaged or out-of-sequence frames that arrive. The transmitter may simply retransmit these frames

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Error Control:</mark>

The most common <mark style="background:#69E772;">error control</mark> techniques use some or all of these elements use some or all of these elements

Collectively, these <mark style="background:#69E772;">error control</mark> techniques are called <mark style="background:#69E772;">Automatic Repeat Requests</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">ARQ</mark>):
- Stop-and-Wait ARQ
- Go-back-N ARQ
- Selective-reject ARQ

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Stop-and-Wait ARQ:</mark>

This technique is an enhancement to the Stop-and-Wait Flow Control Technique:

Recall that the Tx transmits a frame and awaits and ACK before continuing

If the frame contains an error, the Receiver simply discards it and does not return an ACK

If the frame is not acknowledged after a time-out period the Transmitter simply retransmits the frame

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Problem:</mark>
- If ACK is sent but damaged in transit, the transmitter will resend the frame after time-out
- The Receiver will now get <mark style="background:#69E772;">two</mark> copies of the frame

![](https://i.imgur.com/RYyQ9Rs.png)


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Solution:</mark>
- Frames are alternatively numbered 1 or 0 and ACKs are correspondingly numbered 0 or 1

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Go-back-N ARQ:</mark>

This technique is an enhancement to the Sliding Window Flow Control technique

Recall that the Tx can send a number of frames (up to some window size) <mark style="background:#69E772;">without</mark> having to receive some form of ACK from the Rx

In relation to the types of error (or non-error) conditions that can occur:
- Successful Transmission,
- Lost Data or Lost ACK frame
- Damaged Data Frame

If <mark style="background:#69E772;">NO</mark> errors occur i.e. frames arrive in sequence <mark style="background:#69E772;">and</mark> undamaged:
- The Receiver returns a positive ACK e.g. RR4 or RNR4, with the number of the next frame expected
- This ACK can be sent as an <mark style="background:#69E772;">explicit</mark> message in its own frame, or, it can be piggybacked onto an outgoing Data Frame (implicitly)
- The Transmitter continues to send Data Frames up to the agreed <mark style="background:#69E772;">window</mark> size

If <mark style="background:#69E772;">Errors</mark> there are two responses depending on the type of error:
- Lost Frames/Damaged Frames (Lost Frames are detected as <mark style="background:#69E772;">out-of-sequence</mark> frames)
- Lost ACKs

<mark style="background:#69E772;">For Lost Frames and Damaged Frames:</mark>
- They are treated the same
- The Receiver sends a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Reject</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">REJ</mark>) message with the number of the next frame expected e.g. REJ 4.
- The Sending Station, upon receipt of this REJ message, retransmits <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> frames starting at the number included in the message. This is regardless of whether subsequent frames have arrived intact -they are simply discarded

<mark style="background:#69E772;">For Lost ACKs:</mark>
- Here the transmitter station has not received any messages (positive or negative ACKs) from the receiver station
- Recall the use of a Timer for each frame that is transmitted. The timer has a part to play here

Depending on whether the timer for a frame expires, the transmitter can respond as follows:
- If a timer has <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> expired it can continue to send more frames up to the <mark style="background:#69E772;">window</mark> size. This is not considered an error condition

If a <mark style="background:#69E772;">timer</mark> does expire, the transmitter immediately stops transmitting Data frames:
- It then sends a 'special' RR message with the <mark style="background:#69E772;">poll</mark> bit set
- This is considered a <mark style="background:#69E772;">command</mark> frame
- The Receiver <mark style="background:#69E772;">must</mark> respond with an RR of its own identifying the number of the next frame expected

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Selective Reject ARQ:</mark>

This is very similar to the Go-back-N technique with the exception that the only frames retransmitted are:
- Transmitted frames for which a timer has expired i.e. a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Lost ACK</mark> or,
- Transmitted frames that were <mark style="background:#69E772;">lost</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">damaged</mark>. The receiver uses a slightly different Negative ACK - it's called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Selective Reject</mark> (SREJ) message
- The number of the frame to be re-transmitted is also included e.g. SREJ 5

This is considered more efficient than Go-Back-N as it minimises the amount of re-transmitted frames

However, this technique is also more complex than Go-Back-N as the Receiver station has to:
- Store frames received <mark style="background:#69E772;">after</mark> a Damaged frame has been rejected
- It has to re-sequence retransmitted frames as they arrive <mark style="background:#69E772;">out-of-sequence</mark>
- This requires more complex logic on both the Transmitter and Receiver stations

Hence, <mark style="background:#69E772;">Go-back-N</mark> ARQ is often preferred over <mark style="background:#69E772;">Selective Reject</mark> ARQ
