### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Medium Access Control:</mark>

Gaining access to a LAN is a fundamental requirement for Data Transmission between stations.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Access can be controlled either:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Centrally:</mark> Stations must obtain permission before accessing the transmission medium
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Distributed:</mark> Access is controlled by stations acting <mark style="background:#69E772;">together</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages of Centrally Controlled:</mark>
- The access logic required at each station is simple
- There is no co-ordination required between stations

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Disadvantages of Centrally Controlled:</mark>
- Single point of failure. If the controlling device develops a fault all stations are affected
- Potential <mark style="background:#69E772;">bottleneck</mark>. All "requests for access" must be sanctioned by a central device
- Distributed access will be discussed later

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Three generalised access control techniques:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Reservation (will not be covered):</mark>
- Medium is divided into <mark style="background:#69E772;">time</mark> slots
- Station wishing to send has to <mark style="background:#69E772;">reserve</mark> future slots
- Very suited to stream traffic i.e. <mark style="background:#69E772;">long</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">continuous</mark> transmissions on an <mark style="background:#69E772;">irregular</mark> basis

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Round Robin:</mark>
- Each station takes a turn to transmit data
- Efficient only if stations have a lot of data to transmit on a <mark style="background:#69E772;">regular</mark> basis

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Contention:</mark>
- Continued.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">MAC - Contention:</mark>

Each station contends for access when needed

The technique is <mark style="background:#69E772;">distributed</mark> by nature

Works on a <mark style="background:#69E772;">"First Come/First Served"</mark> basis and is easy to implement

Very suited to <mark style="background:#69E772;">bursty</mark> traffic i.e. short, sporadic transmissions

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ethernet's Contention Access Technique:</mark>

Ethernet - an example of a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bus/Star</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">LAN</mark>

It employs a Contention MAC technique known as a "<mark style="background: #69E772;">Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection </mark>(<mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA</mark>/<mark style="background:#69E772;">CD</mark>)"

It is <mark style="background:#69E772;">random</mark> and requires each station to contend for access to the shared transmission medium

The most commonly used MAC technique for <mark style="background:#69E772;">bus</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">star</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">LANs</mark>

Defined under IEEE802.3 standard

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA - Basic Operation:</mark>

Steps followed by a station when it wishes to transmit Data frames:
- The station listens to the medium for activity (known as carrier sense)
- If the medium is clear of traffic the station begins transmission immediately
- If the medium is in use, the station waits a random period of time before it attempts to transmit the Data frame.

In normal operation, transmitting stations can send multiple frames and would expect ACKs in the return direction: Recall ARQ techniques: Go-Back-N and Selective Reject.

The problem with this access technique:

It is possible for two or more stations to attempt transmit at approximately the same time.

This will lead to a <mark style="background:#69E772;">collision</mark> i.e. a <mark style="background:#69E772;">garbled</mark> transmission. Recall what happens when <mark style="background:#69E772;">digital</mark> signals meet

![](https://i.imgur.com/RkvPZLz.png)


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Collisions</mark> are an example of frames "going missing":
- Recall scenarios outlined in discussions on Go-Back-N and Selective Reject
- Collisions can lead to "out-of-sequence" frames and/or "missing" RR messages

Recall in the ARQ techniques that a transmitting station:
- Sets a timer for each frame transmission
- Expects an ACK from the destination station
- Takes action after a <mark style="background:#69E772;">timeout</mark> period using command-responses (Poll/Final bit)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA Characteristics:</mark>

CSMA results in <mark style="background:#69E772;">poor</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">utilisation</mark> of the link

The medium remains <mark style="background:#69E772;">unusable</mark> for the time taken to clear the collision

The <mark style="background:#69E772;">transmitting</mark> station is reliant upon the non-return of an acknowledgement to detect a problem

To counteract this inefficiency CSMA was extended to include <mark style="background:#69E772;">collision detection</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA/CD - Basic Operation:</mark>

As before, the station listens to the medium before attempting to transmit

<mark style="background:#69E772;">During</mark> transmission the station <mark style="background:#69E772;">continues</mark> to <mark style="background:#69E772;">listen</mark> to the medium for a <mark style="background:#69E772;">collision</mark>, known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">Collision Detection</mark>:

If present, the station ceases transmission immediately

The station then transmits a brief jamming signal to inform all other stations of collision

The station waits a random amount of time (delta) before attempting to retransmit

Additional collisions are dealt with using a <mark style="background:#69E772;">binary exponential backoff</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA versus CSMA/CD:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Without</mark> the use of CSMA/CD collisions would <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> be detected

If the affected frame was a data frame, then the Rx'er would likely interpret the next frame <mark style="background:#69E772;">as</mark> an out-of-sequence frame and would return a REJ message

If the collided frame was a returning ACK, the Tx'er would not receive an RR message for an outstanding frame.

Recall: Its timer would expire and it would have to send an RR message with the Poll bit set

Consequently the overall time to send multiple frames would be extended as the communicating station would have to rely on <mark style="background:#69E772;">Timers</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">REJ</mark> messages to recover from collisions

<mark style="background:#69E772;">With</mark> Collision Detection collisions <mark style="background:#69E772;">would</mark> be detected

The Tx'ing station would stop transmitting the frame and would wait a random period before attempting to re-transmit. The Rx'er should eventually receive the frame

Collision Detection, in part, addresses some of the issues normally addressed with error control, namely "lost" frames. The Tx'er does not have to rely on returning ACKs/NACKs

Consequently the overall time to send multiple frames would be reduced as the Tx'er would only have to wait for the collision to disappear from the segment in order to re-transmit the frame

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA Characteristics:</mark>

The use of CSMA/CD is beneficial:
- By reducing the "down-time" of the LAN segment, "Link-Utilisation" is improved
- The time to deliver multiple frames is improved

However, <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame-size</mark> (length) is critical
- Short frames prevent <mark style="background:#69E772;">collision</mark> detection
- Frames have to be a minimum length
- Consequently the MAC frame format includes a special field called <mark style="background:#69E772;">Pad</mark>: Extra octets ("random data") can be added to the frame

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ring LANs:</mark>

Consists of a number of stations, each of which is connected to a <mark style="background:#69E772;">repeater</mark>

These in turn are connected to two other repeaters by <mark style="background:#69E772;">unidirectional</mark> transmission links to form a ring

Data is transferred <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit-by-bit</mark> around the ring from one repeater to the next

The repeaters <mark style="background:#69E772;">regenerate</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">retransmit</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">each</mark> bit

![](https://i.imgur.com/x74Znjd.png)


### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ring LANs - Repeater functionality:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame Insertion:</mark> Frames (with addresses) are placed onto the Tx medium by the repeater

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame reception:</mark> As a frame passes through a repeater the address field is copied to the station. If the station recognises the address, the entire frame is copied

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame Removal:</mark> A repeater can remove a frame by not repeating it to the next link. Either the <mark style="background:#69E772;">addressed repeater</mark> can remove the data or, the <mark style="background:#69E772;">transmitting station</mark> can remove it (after one round trip)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Example Access Technique - Token Ring:</mark>

The most commonly used MAC technique for ring LANs is IBM Token Ring. This is a round robin technique and is defined under the IEEE802.5 standard

Token Ring uses a small frame, called a Token:
- The token circulates around the <mark style="background:#69E772;">ring</mark> indefinitely
- A station wishing to transmit must <mark style="background:#69E772;">seize</mark> the token and remove it from the LAN.

The token is then transformed into a <mark style="background:#69E772;">start-of-frame</mark> field for a <mark style="background:#69E772;">data frame</mark>

More fields are added to construct a data frame.

The token is effectively removed from the ring and replaced by a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame</mark>

When the frame returns to the <mark style="background:#69E772;">transmitting</mark> station it removes the <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame</mark> from the ring and inserts a <mark style="background:#69E772;">new</mark> token

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Token Ring Operation:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/OSgCDJV.png)


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Token Ring Advantages:</mark>
- Access is efficient and fair under heavy traffic loads

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Token Ring Disadvantages:</mark>
- Access can be inefficient under <mark style="background:#69E772;">light</mark> traffic loads. A station must wait for a token before transmitting
- There is a requirement for <mark style="background:#69E772;">token maintenance</mark>
- Tokens can be lost or duplicated
- One station is assigned responsibility for token maintenance

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Star LANs:</mark>

Uses a central component known as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">hub</mark>

Two types of hub:
- Shared-medium hub
- Switched LAN hub

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Shared Medium hub (hub-star LAN):</mark>

Transmission from any station is repeated to <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> stations

Only <mark style="background:#69E772;">one</mark> station can transmit at any one time. This is the same behaviour as a Bus Lan

Hence this type of <mark style="background:#69E772;">star</mark> LAN is also known as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">star-shaped bus</mark> (as opposed to a <mark style="background:#69E772;">simple bus</mark> LAN)

Advantages of <mark style="background:#69E772;">star-shaped</mark> bus LAN: Can use existing building wiring

![](https://i.imgur.com/0zbFokW.png)


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Switched LAN hub (Switched-star LAN):</mark>

Acts as a switch i.e. incoming frame is only passed to the addressed station

Frames from <mark style="background:#69E772;">other</mark> stations can be switched simultaneously

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Greater</mark> performance can be achieved with a <mark style="background:#69E772;">switched LAN</mark> hub <mark style="background:#69E772;">over</mark> a shared-medium hub

![](https://i.imgur.com/duECb6H.png)


Switched-LANs provides improved performance because there is <mark style="background: #69E772;">no contention</mark>

Multiple simultaneous communications between pairs of stations can be facilitated

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Wireless LAN:</mark>

The specification for wireless LANs is called IEEE 802.11.

This specification defines two types of architecture:
- The Basic Service Set (BSS), and,
- The Extended Service Set (ESS).

<mark style="background:#69E772;">BSS Wireless LAN:</mark>

The BSS typically comprises a number of mobile stations and a central <mark style="background:#69E772;">base</mark> station known as an <mark style="background:#69E772;">Access Point (AP)</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/ohCAt64.png)

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">ESS Wireless LAN:</mark>

The ESS typically comprises two or more BSSs with APs.

The APs are usually connected via a <mark style="background:#69E772;">distribution network</mark> (typically a wired LAN).

Like BSSs, ESSs define two types of stations:
- Stationary stations which usually connect via the wired LAN. These stations include the APs.
- Mobile stations. Some of these stations can only communicate within a single BSS, others between BSSs and yet others between ESSs.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Wireless LAN Access Technique:</mark>

The access technique employed on a wireless LAN is CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)

This is similar to CSMA/CD as follows:
- Before a station can transmit a frame it must detect activity on the shared medium (in this case the air interface).
- Timers and Back-off periods are used in the event that the medium is in use.

As with wired Bus LANs collisions can occur.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Collision Detection on a WLAN:</mark>

Collision Detection (CD) within a Wired LAN relies on a transmitting station being able to detect a collision:
- This is not always the case with a Wireless LAN.
- Due to distances between stations not all transmissions are visible to all stations as per the “Hidden Station Problem”.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Hidden Station Problem:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/1ib77HE.png)


<mark style="background:#69E772;">Collision Avoidance on WLAN:</mark>

The approach to dealing with collisions on a WLAN is to avoid collisions in the first instance.

The technique is known as Collision Avoidance:
- This technique uses fixed timers and a message exchange technique.
- When used with CSMA the technique is called CSMA/CA

<mark style="background:#69E772;">CSMA/CA:</mark>

Message exchange technique uses two messages:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ready To Send</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">RTS</mark>) and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Clear To Send</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">CTS</mark>).

The timers used are called:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Short Inter-Frame Space</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">SIFS</mark>) and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Distributed Inter-Frame Space</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">DIFS</mark>) and,
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Network Allocation Vector</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">NAV</mark>).
