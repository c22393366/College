### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Problems with LAN technologies:</mark>

From previous discussions on LANs there are a variety of <mark style="background:#69E772;">networking</mark> technologies available to facilitate communications between host computers:

For any given LAN implementation, host computers can only communicate with other hosts attached to the <mark style="background:#69E772;">same</mark> networking technology.

It is not unreasonable to assume that many organisations may employ a variety of <mark style="background:#69E772;">technologies</mark>

This is usually for historical reasons due to mergers and take-overs etc.

Historically this can lead to the creation of <mark style="background:#69E772;">islands</mark> of networks within organisations:

Difference in frame formats, Electrical characteristics (voltages, wiring types, etc.) and Addressing Schemes prevented <mark style="background:#69E772;">direct</mark> communications between hosts connected to different LAN technologies

Today, there is a need to facilitate communication between any two hosts regardless of the type of LAN they attach to

This is similar to telephone systems which facilitate communication between any two telephones. For example between a mobile phone and a fixed-line phone

This is known as universal service and is a fundamental concept within networking

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service:</mark>

With <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service</mark>: A user on any host in any part of an organisation can send messages or data to any other user without any knowledge of the underlying networking technology.

Whilst highly desirable <mark style="background:#69E772;">universal service</mark> can be difficult to achieve due to incompatibilities between network technologies.

The provision of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service</mark> for host computers requires addressing the problems associated with <mark style="background:#69E772;">heterogeneous</mark> (multiple) network technologies.

The introduction of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking</mark> technology is the solution.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service through Internetworking:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking introduces a new hardware component and new software :</mark>

Additional hardware is needed to provide a physical interconnection between LANs for the purpose of routing traffic:
- This hardware needs a physical connection to each LAN using the correct NIC.
- Only then can it route and deliver traffic between LANs.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Additional software is also required to:</mark>

Address the <mark style="background:#69E772;">lack of</mark> uniqueness when using MAC addresses,

Address the <mark style="background:#69E772;">lack of</mark> summary routing when using MAC addresses,

Introduce a single, unique <mark style="background:#69E772;">“framing”</mark> structure/format understood by all hosts.

The result is a system of connected physical networks known as an <mark style="background:#69E772;">internetwork</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">internet</mark> as shown in the next slide.

There is no restriction on the size of an <mark style="background:#69E772;">internet</mark>. However, there are reliability, efficiency and performance issues to consider when designing and/or attaching to an internet

<mark style="background:#69E772;">An example of a small internet:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">The Hardware components - Routers:</mark>

The hardware component is called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Router</mark>.

It is a special purpose computer used for <mark style="background:#69E772;">interconnecting</mark> networks:

It is like any host computer in that it contains: a CPU, RAM, I/O interfaces (Network Interface Cards) etc.

Whilst the previous diagram shows a router connecting only two networks; in practise a single router can connect many LANs.

Also, many organisations use <mark style="background:#69E772;">multiple</mark> routers to maximise performance and to allow for <mark style="background:#69E772;">redundancy</mark>.

To provide <mark style="background:#69E772;">universal service</mark> the routers must physically pass data between the LANs

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">The Software Component - Internet Protocol (IP):</mark>

As already discussed, passing data directly between different <mark style="background:#69E772;">LANs</mark> technologies is impossible due to differing <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame formats</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">addressing schemes</mark>.

Internet <mark style="background:#69E772;">protocol software</mark> addresses these issues by:

Introducing a <mark style="background:#69E772;">single</mark> globally-unique addressing scheme:

This single scheme hides the underlying <mark style="background:#69E772;">multiplicity</mark> of physical addressing schemes (recall static, dynamic and configurable MAC addresses) employed on each LAN.

Introducing a <mark style="background:#69E772;">single</mark> “framing” structure called a “Packet/Datagram” that is understood by <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> host computers.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">The IP Datagram/Packet:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking technology - Providing Universal Service for Host Computers:</mark>

The routers combined with the internet protocol software makes universal access possible.

However, internets are really an abstraction

No such network exists in reality, consequently they are often called virtual networks.

We will now examine the concepts behind interworking.

Firstly, we will look at the globally unique addressing scheme design especially for interworks.

Secondly, we will look at the role played by the router in delivering data across different network technologies.
