It is unlikely that two communicating devices will <mark style="background:#69E772;">utilise</mark> fully the capacity of a transmission link. For example, Fibre Optic cables have very high BW and hence can carry a lot of data; more data than would be required for most host-to-host interaction

This <mark style="background:#69E772;">spare</mark> capacity can be used by other communicating devices

The sharing of a data communications facility in the this way is called multiplexing

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Basic Multiplexing Components:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Motivations for using multiplexing:</mark>

Multiplexing is commonly used in communications because:
- Communications equipment is expensive. Hence, the higher the data rate of a transmission system the lower the cost per Kbps.
- Many communicating devices use relatively modest data rates and so can be mixed together on a higher speed system.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Multiplexing Examples:</mark>

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Cable networks:</mark>
- Many communication services are provided on Cable networks such as TV, Broadband, IP Telephony, Radio etc. Each of these services are multiplexed onto the subscriber connection.

<mark style="background:#69E772;">Telecommunications networks:</mark>
- Fibre optical, coaxial cable, and microwave links are used between exchanges and towns/cities,
- Each communications link simultaneously carries many voice and data transmissions between multiple end devices/users.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Types of multiplexing:</mark>

There are two common Multiplexing techniques employed:
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frequency-division multiplexing</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">FDM</mark>) is an <mark style="background:#69E772;">Analogue Transmission</mark> technique which produces an analogue signal from multiplexed analogue and/or digital signals <mark style="background:#69E772;">without</mark> regard to the data,
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Time-division Multiplexing</mark> (<mark style="background:#69E772;">TDM</mark>) is a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Digital Transmission</mark> technique which produces a digital signal from multiplexed analogue and/or digital signals <mark style="background:#69E772;">with</mark> regard to the data.

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frequency Division Multiplexing:</mark>

Used when the useful BW of a transmission link exceeds the BW of individual signals.

Each signal is modulated onto a different <mark style="background:#69E772;">carrier frequency</mark> (known as a subcarrier).

The <mark style="background:#69E772;">carrier frequencies</mark> are combined to produce a <mark style="background:#69E772;">composite</mark> analogue signal (known as a <mark style="background:#69E772;">baseband signal</mark>).

The <mark style="background:#69E772;">baseband signal</mark> is analogue and is transmitted across a single transmission link.

The input <mark style="background:#69E772;">data</mark> may be <mark style="background:#69E772;">analogue</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">digital</mark>.

The BW of the composite signal must be <mark style="background:#69E772;">greater</mark> than the sum of BWs of the individual input signals.

A <mark style="background:#69E772;">guard band</mark> must be inserted between the carrier frequencies to prevent <mark style="background:#69E772;">overlap</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E772;">Synchronous Time-Division Multiplexing:</mark>

This is the digital equivalent of FDM.

Here portions of each input signal are <mark style="background:#69E772;">interleaved</mark> in <mark style="background:#69E772;">time</mark> (as opposed to frequency) onto the transmission medium.

Incoming data carrying signals can be either <mark style="background:#69E772;">analogue</mark> (with encoded digital data) or <mark style="background:#69E772;">digital</mark>.

The interleaving can be at <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit</mark> level or in <mark style="background:#69E772;">blocks</mark> of bytes: This determines the size of the input <mark style="background:#69E772;">buffers</mark>

Data are organised into <mark style="background:#69E772;">frames</mark>.

Frames contain a cycle of <mark style="background:#69E772;">time</mark> slots.

One or more <mark style="background:#69E772;">time</mark> slots within a <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame</mark> is dedicated to <mark style="background:#69E772;">one</mark> pair of data source devices.

The combination of <mark style="background:#69E772;">time slots</mark> across successive frames is called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">channel</mark>: Each pair of data source devices is allocated a <mark style="background:#69E772;">channel</mark> for their communication requirements.

The system is <mark style="background:#69E772;">synchronous</mark> because:
- Time slots are <mark style="background:#69E772;">pre-assigned</mark> to source devices,
- They are transmitted regardless of whether the source devices are sending data.

Frame <mark style="background:#69E772;">synchronisation</mark> is required:
- Achieved using a <mark style="background:#69E772;">separate channel</mark>,
- Known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">Added-digit Framing</mark>.

TDM is used as part of the public long-haul telecommunications system
