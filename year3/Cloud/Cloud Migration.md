Organizational Fit:
- Organizations must assess how cloud fits into their plans, considering finance, performance, security and management
- Normally phases in as a gradual shift

Cloud models:
- Public
- Private
- Hybrid

Considerations for choosing cloud apps
- If it's proprietary and high security risk, best kept off the cloud
- If it's just non-proprietary, can be moved to the cloud, but best kept in house if possible
- Else: Cloud allows for easy migration

Service Level Agreements (SLAs): The quality and reliability of services, like network availability and performance. Also outline penalties for non-compliance

Cloud performance is affected by infrastructure degradation and network latency

Open cloud standards allow for minimized vendor lock in and smooth transition between providers

Cloud Adaptation Phases:
- Assessment: Assess financial, tech, security, compliance. Returns a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI) analysis. Whether existing licenses can be transferred to the cloud must be analysed too.
- Proof of Concept: Verify that apps can perform as expected in the cloud. 
- Migration Phase: 
	- Forklift: Move the entire app at once. Suited for tightly coupled ops
	- Hybrid: Move parts gradually where there are larger dependencies
- Optimization
