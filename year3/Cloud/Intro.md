What is cloud computing?: 
- It's a shift in service delivery by replacing local servers with online ones, allowing remote storage, processing power, and APIs
- It allows for automatic, self service computer resource access
- standard devices can access over a network
- resources are pooled
- Monitored resource usage

Models:
- IaaS: 
	- Virtually limitless storage and computing power
	- Less need for at hand hardware on client side
	- Provides environments to work in 
	- Provides tools and services, as well as SDKs
	- Create and manage virtual OS, though knowledge of the API is normally required
	- Example: Virtual Machine
	- Benefits:
		- scalable
		- Less upfront and committal cost of hardware 
	- Challenges: Users have to manage OS, updates, and data security themselves
- PaaS:
	- Allows devs to build, run, and manage apps without concern for underlying infrastructure
	- Handles dev environment setup, server config, and storage
	- Example: Google App Engine
	- Benefits:
		- Speeds up dev thanks to pre-configured environments
		- Scalable
		- Promotes collab between distributed dev teams
	- Challenges: Vendor lock-in potential from reliance on platform-specific APIs
- SaaS:
	- No dev or resources needed for user
	- software in a central location in a one to many relationship
	- APIs allow for integration between software
	- Apps delivered over the internet
	- Example: Google workspaces
	- Benefits:
		- Easy access from any internet accessing device
		- Auto updates and patch management
		- Users not concerned with infrastructure management or the app itself
