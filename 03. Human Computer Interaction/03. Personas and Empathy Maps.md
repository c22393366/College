### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Why Personas and/or Empathy Maps?</mark>

We need to know the specific characteristics of a population of users to make optimal user interface design decisions for them

The purpose (of these methods) is to establish the general requirements of a category/categories of users in terms of overall interface style and approach

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Characteristics:</mark>

There is no single best user interface style or approach for all users

Consider:
- "Experts" vs. "novices"
- High-frequency Use vs. Sporadic Use etc

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User research to identify characteristics:</mark>

Determine the user's characteristics -
- Psychological characteristics (e.g. attitude, motivation)
- Knowledge and experience (e.g. typing skill, experience)
- Job and task characteristics (e.g. frequency of use, task and structure)
- Physical characteristics (e.g. large person, small person, colour blindness)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Personas:</mark>

"Personas identify the user motivations, expectations and goals responsible for driving online behaviour, and bring users to life by giving them names, personalities and often a photo"

Personas originated in the field of marketing but Cooper (1999) presented a case for their use in systems design

The idea can be used to capture user chracteristics

Often the personae are not real people, but bring them to life with a name, characteristics, goals, personal background

Multiple personas capture many user characteristics

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Designing Personas:</mark>

Three layers for designing personas (Brown, 2010):
- Establishing requirements
- Elaborating relationships
- Making 'em human

The most basic persona will only include the first layer, while the most elaborate will extend to all three layers.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personas - Layers:</mark>


| Layer 1: Establishing requirements | Layer 2: Elaborating relationships | Layer 3: Making 'em human |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Key Distinguishing features        | Concerns                           | Personal background       |
| Descriptive Dimensions             | Scenarios                          | Photo                     |
| Objectives and Motivations         | Quotes                             | System features           |
| Source                             |                                    | Demographic Information   |
|                                    |                                    | Technology comfort        |

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Benefits of Personas:</mark>

Studies such as Long (2009) have shown that personas can result in many benefits, including:
- More usable designs
- More user-centred discussions
- More effective communication in design teams

Create a strong focus on users and their context

Use our mind's ability to extrapolate from partial knowledge of people to create coherent wholes and project them into new situations

Help in discussions like: "Why are we building this feature? Would Kate use this feature?"

A medium for communication: "How many team members will read market research and usability reports?"

"Kate had problems finding this feature" vs. "a section of users had problems finding this feature"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Case for Personas:</mark>

Personas are a useful tool in a human centred design approach to understand and communicate user needs and requirements. If designers want to test potential solutions, but don't have continuous access to the end-users, they can create fictional characters that can be used to represent a collection of the kinds of people who could be using that potential solution, called personas.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Criticisms of Personas:</mark>

Some researchers have criticised the use of personas by pointing out that real users/customers are preferable to the use of personas BUT there are many cases where this is not possible, so personas are an effective, if somewhat inferior, alternative

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is an Empathy Map?</mark>

An empathy map is a simple, easy-to-digest visual that captures knowledge about a user's behaviours and attitudes. It is a useful tool to help system development teams better understand their users.

Empathy mapping is a simple workshop activity that can be done with stakeholders, project managers, systems analysts, programmers, etc. to build empathy for end users

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Using Empathy Maps:</mark>

An empathy map is a collaborative tool.

It allows teams to gain a better understanding of their customers.

Empathy maps can be used to elaborate on user personas.

Empathy maps bridge the gap from persona to design

Creating an effective solution requires understanding the true problem and the person who is experiencing it

The exercise of creating the map helps participants consider things from the user's perspective, along with is, her or their goals and challenges

Empathy maps are most useful at the beginning of a design process;
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">After</mark> user research
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Before</mark> requirements and preliminary designs

The mapping process can help synthesise research observations and reveal deeper insights about a user's needs

They ought to be based on research data but can be built using knowledge gathered from internal participants - or using <mark style="background:#BABD00;">existing personas</mark>

When included in early project stages, the empathy maps help development teams enter the user's world and approach things from his, her, their, point of view before creating solutions

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">The benefits include:</mark>
- Better understanding of the user
- Distilled information in one visual reference
- Callouts of key insights from research
- Fast and inexpensive
- Easily customisable, based on available and goals
- Common understanding among teams

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrants:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Pains:</mark> Challenges and obstacles faced by the user
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Gains:</mark> Goals your users hopes to accomplish

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrant 1 - Think and Feel:</mark>

What does the person <mark style="background:#BABD00;">think</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">feel</mark>?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">When might you use empathy maps?</mark>

Empathy maps might best be employed at the beginning of the design process, but, crucially, after user research.

Sometimes, when time is a factor, empathy maps may be done without user research and based solely on existing knowledge and stakeholder feedback.
