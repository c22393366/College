### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">HCI:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</mark> is the study of the interaction between people, computers and tasks and involves the <mark style="background:#BABD00;">development</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">application</mark> of <mark style="background:#BABD00;">principles</mark>, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">guidelines</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">methods</mark> to support the design and evaluation of interactive systems

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Overview: Map of HCI:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/aYzmb9j.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The interdisciplinary nature of HCI:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Computer Science and Engineering:</mark>
- For faster machines
- For faster systems
- As a means of building better interfaces

 <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Psychology:</mark>
- To better understand the user
- For modelling the user (as a thinking entity)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Sociology:</mark>
- For group work and groupware

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Anthropology and Ergonomics:</mark>
- For body shape and equipment design

 <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Physiology:</mark>
- For physical capabilities

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design:</mark>
- For user interface layout

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Art:</mark>
- For aesthetics

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Linguistics:</mark>
- For the language of commands

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Philosophy:</mark>
- To allow for contextual consistency

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Artificial Intelligence:</mark>
- For modelling the user (in relation to software)


###  <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Human of HCI:</mark>

To the user, information is input and output as:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Visual</mark> - seeing
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Auditory</mark> - hearing
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Haptic</mark> - touching and being aware of location
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Movement</mark> - positioning

To the user, information is stored in memory:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Sensory memory</mark> - visual, auditory and tactile
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Short-term memory</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Long-term memory</mark>

To the user, information is processed and applied with:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Reasoning</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Problem solving</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Skill</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Error</mark>

Emotion influences human capabilities

As HCI designers, engineers and programmers we must remember that <mark style="background:#BABD00;">each person is different</mark>

Other considerations for the user:
- Motivation
- Enjoyment
- Satisfaction
- Experience level

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Computer in HCI:</mark>

There are a huge range of computers and types of applications - HCI is a concern for all of them

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">The System:</mark>
- PCs
- Nuclear Systems
- Laptops

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Use and Context of Computers:</mark>

Problems of fitting together computers, their uses, and the context of use:

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Social organisation and work:</mark>

Where humans are interacting social beings

Considers models of human activity e.g. small groups, organisations, socio-technical systems, etc.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Application areas:</mark>

With characteristics of application domains, e.g. individual versus group work

May have popular styles in:
- Document production
- Communications
- Design
- Tutorials
- Etc

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The "Human-Machine fit" and adaptation:</mark>

To improve the fit between the designed object and its use

How systems are selected and adopted

How users improvise routine systems

How systems adapt to the user (customisation)

How users adapt to the system (training, ease of learning)

User guidance (help, documentation, error handling)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Interaction of HCI:</mark>

The <mark style="background:#BABD00;">PROCESS</mark>

To understand HCI, we need to understand computers and the processes associated with their systems

![](https://i.imgur.com/kMg5sIr.png)


<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interacting with computers:</mark>

Some years ago (50-60), computers performed batch processing.

Punched card stacks or large data stacks were prepared. There was a long wait, line printer output and if it was not right, you would have to start again

These days, most computing is interactive:
- Rapid feedback
- The user in control (most of the time)
- 'doing rather than thinking'

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design for interactivity:</mark>

An interactive design may aim to <mark style="background:#BABD00;">update</mark> or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">replace</mark> an established system or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">develop</mark> a totally innovative product

There may be an initial set of requirements or the project may have to begin producing a set of requirements from scratch

Regardless of the initial situation, the following must be discussed, refined, clarified and probably rescoped:
- The aim of the project
- Users needs
- Requirements
- Users' aspirations and expectations

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Requirements:</mark>

Design for interactivity requires an understanding of:
- the users
- the current tasks
- the goals
- conditions under which the product will be used
- constraints on the products performance

To specify and design a "<mark style="background:#BABD00;">usable</mark>" interface, the software designer must develop an understanding of the user, what they want and what they will do as a result of the proposed system

This is a complex problem with many questions

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">A need to understand users:</mark>

In order to achieve "good" UI design, participation in the process of understanding users and evolving requirements is essential. 

In order to design an effective UI, basic questions should be answered:
- Who is the user?
- What is the interaction taking place?
- What is the task?
- What is the environment in which the system will operate?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Understanding the User:</mark>

There are many approaches to understand users using a range of user research methods:
- Observation
- Interview
- Questionnaire
- Focus Groups

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Lecture Summary:</mark>
- Introduction to the subject of HCI
- Disciplines associated with HCI
- Humans and Interfacing
- Computers and Interfacing
- Interaction
- Understanding the user

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Requirements Recap:</mark>

An interactive design may aim to:
- Update or replace an established system
- Develop a totally innovative product

There may be:
- An initial set of requirements or
- The project may have to begin producing a set of requirements from scratch

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Centred Design:</mark>
- Who are the users?
- What activities are being carried out?
- Where is the interaction taking place?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Understanding the User:</mark>

As introduced last week, there are many approaches to understand users using a range of user research methods
- Observation
- Interview
- Questionnaire
- Focus Groups

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quantitative and Qualitative Studies:</mark>

Quantitative and qualitative studies may be useful to the research into understanding users
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quantitative data</mark> - expressed as numbers
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Qualitative data</mark> - difficult to measure sensibly as numbers, e.g. counting the number of words to measure dissatisfaction
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quantitative analysis</mark> - numerical methods to ascertain size, magnitude, amount
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Qualitative analysis</mark> - Expresses the nature of elements and is represented as themes, patterns, stories
- Be careful how you manipulate data and numbers

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Data Gathering:</mark>

Data gathering is a central part of identifying needs and establishing requirements and of evaluation

Many techniques are available, each has its advantages and disadvantages

What techniques could we use to gather data about user behaviours, needs, etc?

![](https://i.imgur.com/BGeys8A.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/1rRRKFo.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Data Gathering:</mark>

Whatever method is employed, data will need to be recorded:
- Notes
- Audio
- Video
- Photographs
- Analytics

Consent is often required for user research - written, informed consent

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Setting Goals:</mark>

What questions are we trying to answer?

What do we need to know at this point in the UI or UX design process?

What are the gaps in our knowledge that we aim to fill?

"What features do our users value the most?"

"Do our users enjoy using our product?"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Identifying Participants:</mark>

The effort of identifying participants should represent the target users

Participants may be users of the current system or similar (a competitor's system, a new system)

Participants might also be atypical users

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Recruiting Users for Requirements Gathering:</mark>

Who are the users of the system being investigated?

Are they current users of a similar system?

Could there be a number of stakeholders involved?

Could there be different kinds of users? For example, to design a learning tool, you must consider students, lecturers, perhaps administrators

You cannot interview them all but try to find people representative of user groups

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Recruitment Incentives:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Incentives</mark> - recruitment incentives for participants:
- Monetary
- Non-monetary
- Voluntary

Reusing participants can be done, but this should be avoided when evaluating the user's first experience, ease of learning, or multiple iterations of the same design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Three Main Methods:</mark>

- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Observations

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interviews - Three Types:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Unstructured</mark> - are not directed by a script. Rich but not replicable.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Structured</mark> - are tightly scripted, often like a questionnaire. Replicable but may lack richness

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Semi-structured</mark> - guided by a script but interesting issues can be explored in depth. These can provide a good balance between richness and replicability

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interviews:</mark>

Interviews could be seen as a forum for talking to people

Props. e.g. sample scenarios of use, prototypes, etc can be used in interviews

Interviews are good for exploring issues but are time consuming and it may be unfeasible to visit everyone who is a user

If conducting an interview, think about how you phrase questions:

Are they leading?

Some information may be better gained from observation

Open ended questions can lead to more insightful answers

Don't ask questions that are for the designer, e.g. "How do you think x should be redesigned?"

Ask about user's own preferences and experiences

Be careful of absolute scales, instead ask people to compare the product to something else

Try to avoid Yes/No

Open ended questions are good for the beginning of an interview

Silence is golden, don't jump in. Let participants think about their answers

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interview Questions:</mark>

Two types:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Closed Questions</mark> have a predetermined answer format
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Open questions</mark> do not have a predetermined format

Closed questions are easier to analyse

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Avoid:</mark>
- Long questions
- Compound sentences - "Is this tool interesting and useful?"
- Jargon and language the interviewee may not understand
- Leading questions that make assumptions
- Unconscious biases, e.g. gender stereotypes

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prompts:</mark>

Think about prompts that you can use if a participant answers with short responses but remember not to lead

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Running the interview:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Introduction</mark> - introduce yourself, explain the goals of the interview, reassure about ethical issues, ask to record, present any informed consent forms

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Warm-up</mark> - make first questions easy and non-threatening

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Main body</mark> - present questions in a logical order

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">cool-off</mark> period - include a few easy questions to defuse tension at the end

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Closure</mark> - thank interviewee, signal the end, e.g. turn off the recorder

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Probing Questions:</mark>

Follow-up questions in user interviews gather more detailed information from participants than they provided in their initial answers to our planned questions.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaires:</mark>

Questionnaires are often presented as a series of questions designed to elicit specific information

Questionnaires are often used in conjunction with other techniques

They can give <mark style="background:#BABD00;">quantitative</mark> or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">qualitative</mark> data

They are useful for answering specific questions from a large, dispersed group of people

Questions can be closed or open

Closed questions are easier to analyse and may be done by computer

Questionnaires can be administered to large populations

Paper, email, web and social networks are used for dissemination

Sampling can be a problem when the size of a population is unknown as is common online

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaire design:</mark>

The impact of a question can be influenced by question order

Do you need different versions of the questionnaire for different populations?

Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire

Strike a balance between using white space and keeping the questionnaire compact

Decide on whether phrases will all be positive, all negative or fixed

Consider starting the questionnaire by asking for demographic information, e.g. age, gender, place of birth, computer proficiency, details of relevant experience, etc

This provides potentially useful context

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Question and Response Format:</mark>

'Yes' and 'No' checkboxes

Scales

![](https://i.imgur.com/560g2qN.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/HjZuOZO.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Encouraging a good response:</mark>

Make sure the purpose of the study is clear

Promise anonymity

Ensure questionnaire is well designed

Offer a short version for those not able to complete a long questionnaire

Follow up with emails, phone calls, letters

Provide an incentive

40% response rate is high, 20% is often acceptable

Plan accordingly

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaires - Advantages:</mark>

Responses are usually received quickly

Data can be collected in database for analysis

Time required for data analysis is reduced

Errors can be corrected easily

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaires - Disadvantages:</mark>

Sampling is problematic if population size in unknown

Preventing individuals from responding more than once

Greater potential for abuse

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Observation:</mark>

Observation is about observing people to find a problem or empathise with users

Strategies to observe users will be needed

Ethnography might be important. Also, tacit knowledge, everyday behaviours, intuitions, what is the wider context? How does the technology embed itself into the wider ecology of the user's life

Pay attention to the user's strategies and workarounds

Identify user frustrations

Also errors that users make are important to improving the interface

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Focus group:</mark>

Workshop or focus group:
- Good at gaining a consensus view and/or
- highlighting areas of conflict

"User panels" can be an excellent forum for group activity

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Diary Studies:</mark>

Diary studies capture long term information

These studies record a specific piece of information - could be paper, video, audio

Entry must be as easy as possible

A researcher can follow up and remind users during the study to provide diary entries

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Experience Sampling:</mark>

While researching using Experience Sampling, you can alert participants to give feedback or information at a particular time or location

Experience Sampling might be useful for aggregating information across lots of people

It may be easier for sample data entries to be filled in automatically

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Other Methods:</mark>

Lead Users as collaborative researchers or designers: the researcher/designer can translate an expert user's idea into something more universal

Extreme users: we can learn from the "extremes of use"

Keep real end users in mind: create Personas that contain demographics motivations

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Other approaches to User Requirements:</mark>

Who are the stakeholders?
- Those who are responsible for the UI's design and development,
- Those with a financial interest
- Those responsible for introducing and maintaining the UI in an organisation
- Those who have an interest in its use

You may need to use a particular approach to find this out. Example:
- Cooperative Requirements Capture approach (CRC)
- Structured System Analysis and Design Method (SSADM)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">First</mark> - an investigation of the current environment (developing a logical picture of present activities and future needs)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Second</mark> - alternative courses of actions are derived for the Project Manager to select from (Business system options)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">SSADM</mark> is largely a process-oriented and data-oriented approach

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis:</mark>

Task analysis could be seen as the study of what a user is required to do, in terms of actions and/or cognitive processes, to achieve a system goal

It is "an umbrella term that covers techniques for investigating cognitive processes and physical actions, at a high level of abstraction and in minute detail"

Task Analysis models how the user would use a system
- What should be added?
- Where do new features fit?
- What can be left out?
- What's most critical?
- What's most frequently done?

It may help to choose a high-level interaction or think about a conceptual model

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">goal</mark> can be defined as something the user wishes to achieve.

The goal can be, for example, writing a letter, making an order, depositing money

To reach a goal the user usually needs a plan which involves a set of tasks to be performed in order to reach a goal

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">task</mark> is the series or activities or actions required to achieve a goal.

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">task</mark> is a structured set of activities. The task can involve problem solving or selecting between alternative actions

An <mark style="background:#BABD00;">action</mark> is a simple task which requires no problem solving. An action has no structure.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Hierarchical Task Analysis:</mark>

Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) focuses on physical and observable actions and includes looking at actions not related to software or an interaction device

HTA starts with a user goal which is examined and the main tasks for achieving it are identified

These tasks are then divided into sub-tasks

![](https://i.imgur.com/n4mtQeY.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Limitations of HTA:</mark>

Real tasks are often very complex

Real problems become too big and complex to analyse and describe

There is a limit to the sort of task that can be modelled

Tasks that overlap each other or are done in parallel are hard to describe, as well as interruptions in the task or unusual flows in the task

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Alternatives to Task Analysis:</mark>

Alan Cooper argued that the most important part of interaction design is not the task but the user's goals

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">goal</mark> is a final state

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">task</mark>, on the other hand, is a process in-between, which is required to achieve the goal. A focus on the task can result in a design that supports tasks that are not essential to the user or are not designed properly

A proper analysis of the user's goals will lead to the essential tasks, which will give a better and more usable system, according to Cooper. His method to achieve this is called goal-directed design. An important ingredient is also to describe the user as a <mark style="background:#BABD00;">persona</mark>

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personas:</mark>

A persona is a model of a user that focuses on the individual's goals when using an artefact

The model has a specific purpose as a tool for software and product design

The persona model resembles classical user profiles, but with some important distinctions. It is an archetypal representation of real or potential users. It's not a description of a real, single user or average user.

The persona represents patterns of user's behaviour, goals and motives, compiled in a fictional description of a single individual. It also contains made-up personal details, in order to make the persona more "tangible and alive" for the development team

Not necessarily a real person

Use this as a surrogate user

Details matter, they make the person "real"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Example persona:</mark>

- Betty is 37 years old. She has been Warehouse Manager for five years, and worked for Simpson Brothers Engineering for twelve years. She did not go to university, but has studied on evening classes for a business diploma. She has two children aged 15 and 11, and does not like to work late. She did part of an introductory in-house computer course some years ago, but it was interrupted when she was promoted and could no longer afford the time to study. Her vision is perfect, but her right-hand movement is slightly restricted following an industrial accident 3 years ago. She is enthusiastic about her work and is happy to delegate responsibility and take suggestions from her staff. However, she does feel threatened by the introduction of yet another new computer system (- the third in her time at Simpson Brothers Eng.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personas vs User Profiles:</mark>

Cooper's personas are very different to user profiles which are trying to capture the average or generic user

Instead, his personas are like characters that can interact together to depict user goals

There is a risk that designers may make up characters without basing them on real users

Also, they may represent "extreme users"

You also need to think of "average" target users

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Why Personas and/or Empathy Maps?</mark>

We need to know the specific characteristics of a population of users to make optimal user interface design decisions for them

The purpose (of these methods) is to establish the general requirements of a category/categories of users in terms of overall interface style and approach

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Characteristics:</mark>

There is no single best user interface style or approach for all users

Consider:
- "Experts" vs. "novices"
- High-frequency Use vs. Sporadic Use etc

![](https://i.imgur.com/gcVR5Ty.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/wZPs5SU.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User research to identify characteristics:</mark>

Determine the user's characteristics -
- Psychological characteristics (e.g. attitude, motivation)
- Knowledge and experience (e.g. typing skill, experience)
- Job and task characteristics (e.g. frequency of use, task and structure)
- Physical characteristics (e.g. large person, small person, colour blindness)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Personas:</mark>

"Personas identify the user motivations, expectations and goals responsible for driving online behaviour, and bring users to life by giving them names, personalities and often a photo"

Personas originated in the field of marketing but Cooper (1999) presented a case for their use in systems design

The idea can be used to capture user chracteristics

Often the personae are not real people, but bring them to life with a name, characteristics, goals, personal background

Multiple personas capture many user characteristics

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Designing Personas:</mark>

Three layers for designing personas (Brown, 2010):
- Establishing requirements
- Elaborating relationships
- Making 'em human

The most basic persona will only include the first layer, while the most elaborate will extend to all three layers.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personas - Layers:</mark>


| Layer 1: Establishing requirements | Layer 2: Elaborating relationships | Layer 3: Making 'em human |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Key Distinguishing features        | Concerns                           | Personal background       |
| Descriptive Dimensions             | Scenarios                          | Photo                     |
| Objectives and Motivations         | Quotes                             | System features           |
| Source                             |                                    | Demographic Information   |
|                                    |                                    | Technology comfort        |

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Benefits of Personas:</mark>

Studies such as Long (2009) have shown that personas can result in many benefits, including:
- More usable designs
- More user-centred discussions
- More effective communication in design teams

Create a strong focus on users and their context

Use our mind's ability to extrapolate from partial knowledge of people to create coherent wholes and project them into new situations

Help in discussions like: "Why are we building this feature? Would Kate use this feature?"

A medium for communication: "How many team members will read market research and usability reports?"

"Kate had problems finding this feature" vs. "a section of users had problems finding this feature"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Case for Personas:</mark>

Personas are a useful tool in a human centred design approach to understand and communicate user needs and requirements. If designers want to test potential solutions, but don't have continuous access to the end-users, they can create fictional characters that can be used to represent a collection of the kinds of people who could be using that potential solution, called personas.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Criticisms of Personas:</mark>

Some researchers have criticised the use of personas by pointing out that real users/customers are preferable to the use of personas BUT there are many cases where this is not possible, so personas are an effective, if somewhat inferior, alternative

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is an Empathy Map?</mark>

An empathy map is a simple, easy-to-digest visual that captures knowledge about a user's behaviours and attitudes. It is a useful tool to help system development teams better understand their users.

Empathy mapping is a simple workshop activity that can be done with stakeholders, project managers, systems analysts, programmers, etc. to build empathy for end users

![](https://i.imgur.com/MRrhBMF.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/YqSttg1.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Using Empathy Maps:</mark>

An empathy map is a collaborative tool.

It allows teams to gain a better understanding of their customers.

Empathy maps can be used to elaborate on user personas.

Empathy maps bridge the gap from persona to design

Creating an effective solution requires understanding the true problem and the person who is experiencing it

The exercise of creating the map helps participants consider things from the user's perspective, along with is, her or their goals and challenges

Empathy maps are most useful at the beginning of a design process;
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">After</mark> user research
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Before</mark> requirements and preliminary designs

The mapping process can help synthesise research observations and reveal deeper insights about a user's needs

They ought to be based on research data but can be built using knowledge gathered from internal participants - or using <mark style="background:#BABD00;">existing personas</mark>

When included in early project stages, the empathy maps help development teams enter the user's world and approach things from his, her, their, point of view before creating solutions

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">The benefits include:</mark>
- Better understanding of the user
- Distilled information in one visual reference
- Callouts of key insights from research
- Fast and inexpensive
- Easily customisable, based on available and goals
- Common understanding among teams

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrants:</mark>

The format varies, but common areas include:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Thinking:</mark> What might your user be thinking? What does this tell you about their beliefs?
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Saying:</mark> What are some quotes and defining words your user said?
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Doing:</mark> What actions and behaviours did you notice?
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Feeling:</mark> What emotions might your subject be feeling

Sometimes added:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Pains:</mark> Challenges and obstacles faced by the user
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Gains:</mark> Goals your users hopes to accomplish

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrant 1 - Think and Feel:</mark>

What does the person <mark style="background:#BABD00;">think</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">feel</mark>?
- What really counts?
- Major preoccupations?
- Worries and aspirations?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrant 2 - Hear:</mark>

What does the person <mark style="background:#BABD00;">hear</mark>?
- What colleagues say
- What managers say
- What system development people say
- What friends say

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrant 3 - See:</mark>

What does the person <mark style="background:#BABD00;">see</mark>?
- Environment
- Friends
- What the workplace offers (hardware, software)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quadrant 4 - Say and Do:</mark>

What does the person <mark style="background:#BABD00;">say</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">do</mark>?
- What are users actually saying about their work?
- What do users actually do in their work?
- What do we wish they were saying?
- Are the things they say accurate?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Pains & Gains (Again):</mark>

What is the person's <mark style="background:#BABD00;">pain</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">gain</mark>?
- What are the user's attitudes in the work environment?
- What appearance do these attitudes have?
- What is the user's behaviour towards others?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">When might you use empathy maps?</mark>

Empathy maps might best be employed at the beginning of the design process, but, crucially, after user research.

Sometimes, when time is a factor, empathy maps may be done without user research and based solely on existing knowledge and stakeholder feedback.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is a storyboard?</mark>

A storyboard is the product of the action of "storyboarding"

Storyboarding is a way to visualise something where there is an activity or many activities ("Think user doing work with a computer system")

A storyboard is usually a series of drawings accompanied by a short textual description, where each drawing details a particular point of interest

A storyboard could be described as a graphic organiser that allows you to plan a narrative or, for instance, a writing objective

Special software can be used to create good storyboards

The linear direction of the cells (individual pictures) is perfect for storytelling, explaining a <mark style="background:#BABD00;">process</mark> and showing a <mark style="background:#BABD00;">passage of time</mark>

During the storyboarding process, you can demonstrate the ideas you want to put across to your audience

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Where did storyboarding come from?</mark>

Storyboarding is associated with film and television industries, where storyboards were used as prompts for the plot development of films and TV programmes

It is attributed, by some, to Disney and the animation film people of Walt Disney's company in the 1930s

It has been used by media companies for many years

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Storyboard examples:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Storyboards - Before and After:</mark>

Storyboards can be used to depict a situation "as is" followed by a depiction of the version "To be"

In other words, you could depict a computer system interface as users see it now, followed by a storyboard showing how it could work after a redesign of the interface

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping:</mark>

Prototyping involves producing an early, inexpensive and scaled down version of a product in order to reveal any problems with the current design

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Example:</mark> A version of software with an interface where the prototype shows stakeholders the interface design before it gets fully coded

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping can be:</mark>
- A series of screen sections
- A storyboard, i.e., a cartoon-like series of scenes
- A cardboard mock-up
- A digital mock-up (possibly interactive)
- A piece of software with limited functionality written in the target language or in another language

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis:</mark>

Task analysis has been described as a "Study of what an operator (or team of operators) is required to do, in terms of actions and/or cognitive processes, to achieve a system goal"

Task Analysis is the <mark style="background:#BABD00;">process of learning</mark> about ordinary users by observing them in action to understand in detail how they perform their tasks and achieve their intended goals

Tasks analysis help <mark style="background:#BABD00;">identify</mark> the tasks that websites and/or applications must support and can also help a developer refine or re-define a website's navigation (or search) by determining the appropriate <mark style="background:#BABD00;">content scope</mark>, or visual <mark style="background:#BABD00;">features</mark> of a software application

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis - its purpose:</mark>

What are your user's goals? What are they trying to achieve?

What users actually do to achieve those goals

What experiences (personal, social, and cultural) users bring to the tasks

How users' previous knowledge and experience influence:
- How they think about their work
- The workflow they follow to perform their tasks

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis - When?</mark>

It is important to perform a task analysis early in the systems development process, in particular, prior to design work.

Task analysis helps support several other aspects of the user-centred design process, including (in a website example):
- Website requirements gathering
- Developing a content strategy and site structure
- Wireframing and prototyping
- Performing usability testing

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Types of task analysis:</mark>

There are several types of task analysis but among the most common techniques used are:

Cognitive Task Analysis, which is focused on understanding tasks that require decision-making, problem-solving, memory, attention and judgement

Hierarchical Task Analysis, which is focused on decomposing a high-level task into subtasks

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis for Fact-Finding:</mark>

Task analysis is used mainly to investigate an existing situation
- It is important not to focus on superficial activities
- What are people trying to achieve?
- Why are they trying to achieve it?
- How are they going about it?

There are many techniques, the most popular is Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Hierarchical task analysis (HTA):</mark>

HTA involves breaking a task down into subtasks, then sub-sub-tasks and so on

These are grouped as plans which specify how the tasks might might performed in practice

HTA focuses on physical and observable actions and includes looking at actions not related to software or an interaction device

Start with a user goal which is examined and the main tasks for achieving it are identified

Tasks are divided into sub-sub tasks

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">HTA Example:</mark>

In order to buy a DVD:
1.  locate DVD
2. add DVD to shopping basket
3. enter payment details
4. complete address
5. confirm order

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis - A Summary Account:</mark>

Task analysis is a method of <mark style="background:#BABD00;">observing participants in action</mark> performing their tasks. Task analysis helps in figuring out how users perform tasks and how a system, product or service should be designed for users <mark style="background:#BABD00;">so that they can achieve their intended goals</mark>

Task Analysis also helps determine what user goals are: what designers might ask for, asking; how do users determine or measure the completion of tasks, what sort of personal, social as well as cultural attributes influence the user's performance, etc.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design Model:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/WzsSgFe.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction Design:</mark>

Interactive products in everyday use support people in their everyday and working lives

Examples include mobile phones, computers, ATMs, washing machines and smart televisions

Are they easy, effortless and enjoyable to use?

Interaction design involves taking into account a number of independent factors, including use of context, type of task and the type or kind of user

As a designer, you need to strive for usability and establish user experience goals

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The interaction design process:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/8eLDznd.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User's involvement in Design:</mark>

- Know your user
- Personae
- Cultural investigation

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is user-centred design?</mark>

It is an approach to interactive system development that focuses specifically on making technical products/web interfaces usable

The quality of interaction between the person who uses the products to achieve actual work, the product itself, is the primary goal of user-centred design

User-centred systems empower users and motivate them to learn and explore new system solutions

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Benefits of User-centred Design:</mark>

Understand how to design interactive products that fit with what people want, need and may desire

Appreciate that one size does not fit all, e.g. teenagers are very different to grown ups

Identify any incorrect assumptions they may have about particular user groups e.g. not all older people want or need big fonts

Gives awareness of both people's sensitivities and their capabilities

Gives realistic expectations ⇒ fewer surprises, less disappointment

Timely training may be organised

Makes the users active stakeholders

Users more likely to forgive or accept problems

Can make a big difference to acceptance and success of product

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Star Model (Hartson and Hix, 1989):</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/Cq5q3St.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles of User-centred design:</mark>

Active involvement of users

Appropriate allocation of function between the user and system

Iteration of design solutions

Multidisciplinary design teams

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Essential Activities in UCD:</mark>

Understand and specify the context of use

Specify the user requirements, and organisational requirements

Produce design solutions

Evaluate designs with users against requirements

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction Design - Four Activities:</mark>

1. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Identifying</mark> needs and establishing requirements
2. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Developing</mark> alternative designs
3. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Building</mark> interactive versions of the designs
4. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluating</mark> Designs

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The User -Centred Design Project:</mark>

Project planning has to allow for iteration and for incorporating user feedback.

More time will also be required for effective communication between design team participants and for reconciling potential conflicts and trade-offs.

However, project managers will benefit from the additional creativity and ideas from an extended development team and skill base.

Users will also feel a strong sense of ownership of the system that results.

Above all, proper consideration of usage issues early on in the project will result in a better design and significant savings at later stages when changes are much more costly.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Iterative Design using Prototyping:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/51R1sR4.png)

Generate a prototype of the Design e.g. initial design from guidelines and principles

Evaluate the design; Redesign to correct any errors; Build a new prototype

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototypes:</mark>

In other fields, a prototype is a small-scale model:
- A miniature care
- A miniature building or town

"Users can't tell you what they want, but when they see something and use it, they soon know what they don't want" (Preece)

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">prototype</mark> is an invaluable design tool for testing ideas, clarifying requirements and initiating user input and feedback

Prototyping is a core component of <mark style="background:#BABD00;">iterative design</mark> of information systems

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is a Prototype?</mark>

In HCI design it can be:
- A series of screen sketches
- A storyboard, i.e. a cartoon-like series of scenes
- A PowerPoint slide show
- A video simulating the use of a system
- A lump of wood
- A cardboard mock-up
- A piece of software with limited functionality, written in the target software language or another language

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What to Prototype?</mark>

Prototyping reduces uncertainty
- It can be a major tool for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">risk management</mark>
- Apply it to whatever you might be uncertain about

Prototyping technical issues
- E.g. runtime issues

Prototyping to establish requirements:
- Users "see" functionality

Prototyping for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">usability</mark> concerns

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Things to consider for prototyping:</mark>
- Technical Issues
- Work flow, task design
- Screen layouts and information display
- Difficult, controversial or critical areas of systems design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Types of Prototypes:</mark>

"Fidelity" refers to the <mark style="background:#BABD00;">level of detail</mark>, and much the prototype matches the finished article:
- Low Fidelity
- Medium Fidelity
- High Fidelity

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Low Fidelity Prototypes:</mark>

"Low fidelity" Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium, e.g. paper, cardboard, etc.

It is quick, cheap and easily changed

Examples:
- Sketches of screens
- Task sequences, etc.
- Post-it
- Storyboards
- 'Wizard-of-Oz'

A lo-fi prototype does not look very much like the final product. Material, behaviour etc

Using materials such as paper and cardboard, rather than electronic screens, complex models and detailed code

It is simple, quick and cheap to produce and redesign. It encourages further exploration of alternative designs and ideas.

Lo-fidelity happens at an early stage of development ⇒ prototyping for the conceptual design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Storyboards (as of last week):</mark>

Storyboards are a lo-fi visual representation where steps or actions are represented by panels, like a comic book

Goals are to:
- Flesh out the scenarios in an interaction design 
- Effectively communicate with users or stakeholders

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Sketching:</mark>

Sketching is important to low-fidelity prototyping

You need not be inhibited in your drawing ability. Practice simple symbols. Draw stick people.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Using office supplies:</mark>

Index cards, Post-it notes
- These can represent one page, or one screen
- They can be colour-coded
- Draw on them
- Group them
- Put them on a wall or whiteboard, connect them with string or lines
- Use "write on" tape, clear film, etc.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The original twitter prototype:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/RgVwzcf.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Wizard of Oz Prototyping:</mark>

With this, the user thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a developer is responding to output rather than the system

![](https://i.imgur.com/df96Tqe.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Medium Fidelity Prototypes:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping with a computer:</mark>
- Simulating some, but not all, features of the interface
- This can be engaging for end users

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Purpose:</mark>
- Provides sophisticated, but limited, scenarios for the user to try
- You can test more subtle design issues

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Dangers:</mark>
- User's reactions are often "in the small"
- Users are often reluctant to challenge the designer
- Users are often reluctant to challenge the design
- Management may think it is real

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">High Fidelity Prototypes:</mark>

Hi-fi prototypes use materials that you would expect to be in the final product

The prototype looks much more like the final system than a lo-fi version

Looks very much like the final product

If the prototype is for the software system, a software tool, such as macromedia Director or Blender, Visual Studio or Smalltalk might be needed

Software prototype tools are also often qualified development environments

More time-consuming to produce than lo-fi prototypes

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Benefits:</mark>
- They are the most realistic prototype
- They are closer to the final product
- You can collect metrics at this point

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Limitations:</mark>
- More expensive, less rapid than low or medium fidelity prototypes
- Users might show a reluctance to change when prepared

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping Methods:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Requirements Animation</mark> – functional requirements are demonstrated in a s/w prototype.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Throw-Away prototyping</mark> – similar to requirements animation... and prototype is not developed into the final product.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evolutionary prototyping</mark> – prototype is not discarded and is used as the basis for the next iteration of design. I.E. system “evolves” from prototype.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Incremental prototyping</mark> – final product is built as separate components, one at a time – allows large systems to be installed in phases to avoid delays between specification and delay

![](https://i.imgur.com/rEA1Ngv.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prototyping Specific Tools:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/j6p8RLz.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages and Disadvantages of Lo-Fi prototypes:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages:</mark>
- Lo-fi representations, such as sketches, differ from the final product in interaction design, visual appearance, and/or level of details. The method is quick and cheap, which encourages iterative design idea tryouts between/during usability tests
- Quick lo-fi tests allow designers and users to focus on high-level interaction design and information architecture, rather than on details or visual style

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>
- Users might judge a lo-fi prototype as unprofessional
- While lo-fi prototypes allow spontaneous changes for exploring interactions, they also sacrifice some realism
- Limitations in navigation and flow while a control person has to "make the interaction"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages and Disadvantages of Hi-Fi prototypes:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Advantages:</mark>
- Hi-fi prototypes offer more realistic interactions than lo-fi
- Better at conveying the range of design possibilities
- User-driven

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>
- Hi-fi prototyping may make designers reluctant to change designs and less likely to fully explore the design space
- They take a long time to build and requires skill
- Reviewers and testers tend to comment on surface aspects rather than content

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability:</mark>

Usability is generally regarded as ensuring that interactive products are:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Easy</mark> to learn
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Effective</mark> to use
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Enjoyable</mark> from the user's perspective

Design for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">maximum usability</mark> is the goal of design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is usability?</mark>

Usability can be defined as:
- "The capacity to be used by humans easily and effectively where:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Easily:</mark> to a specified level of subjective assessment
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Effectively:</mark> to a specified level of human performance"
- Shackel, 1990

Usability <mark style="background:#BABD00;">affords</mark> the user easy access to a product's functions

![](https://i.imgur.com/SeRApWi.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Principles:</mark>

Jakob Nielsen defined <mark style="background:#BABD00;">10 usability principles</mark> that can be applied to any system, although frequently used for web application

They are used mainly as a basis for <mark style="background:#BABD00;">evaluating</mark> systems for usability

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics:</mark>

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards.
5. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
6. Error prevention
7. Recognition rather than recall
8. Flexibility and efficiency of use
9. Aesthetic and minimalist design
10. Help and documentation

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Nielsen's Heuristics:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">1)Visibility of System Status</mark>

- Always keep users informed about what is going 


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Introduction:</mark>

Communication is fundamental to being human.

Many features on today’s smart phones were inspired by people with difficulty communicating, seeing or hearing...

Accessibility of technological applications relates to interaction and application design that might be more inclusive . . . and now we use them all!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design:</mark>

Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be <mark style="background:#BABD00;">accessed</mark>, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">understood</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">used</mark> to the greatest extent possible by all people, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">regardless</mark> of their <mark style="background:#BABD00;">age</mark>, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">size</mark> or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">disability</mark>. - Disability Act 2005

In some countries, Universal Design is called ‘Design for all’ (EU) or ‘Inclusive Design’ (CA, UK).

Ireland is the only country that contains a definition of Universal Design in legislation, and that has established a statutory Centre for Excellence in Universal Design

Universal Design is closely related to other design processes such as User Centred Design and UX / CX (Universal eXperience, Customer eXperience).

To meet the needs of the widest range of users, consider the needs of diverse user groups.

Oversample the ‘tails’ on the distribution curve when conducting user research and testing!

![](https://i.imgur.com/eGWMYnS.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design - Buildings and Places:</mark>

The more our buildings and places are designed to accommodate

The widest range of people possible, the more they work for everyone.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design and Diversity:</mark>

Universal Design places diversity at the heart of the design process so that buildings and environments can be used to meet the need of all people, regardless of their
- AGE
- SIZE
- ABILITY
- DISABILITY

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design - Public Services:</mark>

For any service (E.G. public transport) to be inclusive the technology, built environment and products the services use must work together.

Companies can really benefit from “Extending their range of users” by providing mainstream products and services that are easy to access, understand and use by everyone.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design = Accessibility? Not Quite</mark>

Universal Design is not a euphemism for accessibility.

Accessibility features such as ramps and lifts are ‘potent symbols of separateness’.

Universal Design promotes equality of access for all people

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Universal Design is Better Design:</mark>

Universal Design results in better designs for everyone, and the planet.

Universal Design is better design – it works first time for more people and is comfortable and easy to use

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Accessibility:</mark>

Accessibility is a general term used to describe the degree to which a product (for example, a device, service, environment) is accessible by as many people as possible.

As a term, accessibility also relates to the “ability to access” the functionality, and possible benefit, of some system or entity; considering people with disabilities and their right of access to entities.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Example: Blind Users and Computers:</mark>

Computer usage today is predominantly based on graphical interaction, where the visual presentation of information is essential both for input (hand-eye coordination when using a computer mouse), and output (seeing the information on a computer screen).

This can create difficulties for computer users with visual impairment, both at an individual level when interacting with a computer, and also when collaborating with other computer users

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Goals of Human Computer Interaction:</mark>

The goals of HCI are about allowing users to carry out tasks
- Safely
- Effectively
- Efficiently
- Enjoyably

including users with different abilities!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Improving Interfaces for All Abilities:</mark>

How do we improve interfaces for all?
1. Change the attitude of software professionals who think you can just “slap an interface on a system”,
2. Draw upon the fast-accumulating body of knowledge regarding human-computer interface design,
3. Integrate user-interface design methods and techniques into standard software development methodologies.

Know the user, and their:
- Physical abilities
- Cognitive abilities
- Personality differences
- Skill differences
- Cultural diversity
- Motivation
- Special needs

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Age and Accessibility:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/xX4y0px.png)

As this is a perspective on Accessibility, the Age aspect is on older, rather than younger users. So, as an interface designer, you might decide to simplify screen design, provide simple linear search spaces and increase the size of fonts and controls, among other things. You may have to find out more about the specific age and ability of the older user!

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Classification of Aging:</mark>

“Elderly” = > 65 years

“Young Old” = 65 – 74 years

“Middle Aged Old” = 70 – 80 years

“Aged” = > 75 years

“Chronically Old” = > 70 years

“Oldest Old” = 80 years and more

Coleman, Heller and Leventhal (2003)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Everyone has Ability (Capacity to Sense):</mark>

Ability varies <mark style="background:#BABD00;">between</mark> individuals,

Ability varies <mark style="background:#BABD00;">within</mark> individuals,

- There is often compensation for changes in one ability for another.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YObG1dY.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Ability Changes over time:</mark>

Most people have enough abilities in reserve to adapt to changes and environmental restrictions as they get older.

There is some interaction between abilities as systems. (I.E. ability, when seen as systematic, can be matched to a task.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Qpijel0.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Classification of Abilities:</mark>

The WHO (World Health Organisation) has the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICIDH-2). Their document quotes; “As a classification, ICIDH-2 systematically groups different domains for a person in a given health condition (E.G. what a person with a disease or disorder does do or can do). Functioning refers to all body functions, activities and participation as an umbrella term; similarly, disability serves as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions.”

Geneva: World Health Organization (2000)

“ICIDH-2 organizes information in two parts: (1) Functioning and Disability, and (2) Contextual Factors. Each part has two components:

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">1. Components of Functioning and Disability:</mark>
- (a) The Body component comprises two classifications, one for functions of body systems, and one for the body structures. The chapters in both classifications are organized according to the body systems.
- (b) The Activities and Participation component covers the complete range of domains denoting aspects of functioning from both an individual and a societal perspective."

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">2. Contextual Factors:</mark>
- (a) A list of Environmental Factors forms part of the contextual factors. Environmental factors have an impact on all components of functioning and disability and are organized from the individual’s most immediate environment to the general environment.
- (b) Personal Factors are a component of contextual factors but are not classified in the ICIDH-2 because of the large social and cultural variance associated with them.”

The WHO ICIDH-2 gets to a description of computer use by ‘disabled’ users thus: “The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the Performance qualifier and the Capacity qualifier. The Performance qualifier describes what an individual does in his or her current environment... The Capacity qualifier describes an individual’s ability to execute a task or an action. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may reach in a given domain at a given moment...”

Other parts of the WHO document, related to computer accessibility:

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">“CONVERSATION AND USE OF COMMUNICATION DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES (d350-d369):</mark>
- d3601 Using writing machines using machines for writing, such as typewriters, computers and Braille writers, as a means of communication.”

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY</mark>
- e1251 Assistive products and technology for communication adapted or specially designed equipment, products and technologies that assist people to send and receive information, such as specialized vision devices, electro-optical devices, specialized writing devices, drawing or handwriting devices, signalling systems and special computer software and hardware, cochlear implants, hearing aids, FM auditory trainers, voice prostheses, communication boards, glasses and contact lenses.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Specific Laws and Guidelines:</mark>

The Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards)

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web
- Accessibility Initiative (WAI™) and Web Content
- Accessibility Guidelines (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0) 2008
- eEurope; “While many EU Member States already have some form of accessibility legislation, there is no EU law on accessibility.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Navigation Strategies:</mark>
- Older users differed significantly from younger; they searched less efficiently,
- they had the most problems with tasks that required three or more moves,
- they had more difficulty recalling previous moves and the location of previously viewed information

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">More studies:</mark>

Usability and Accessibility of Aging/Health-Related Web Sites - compared usability (Bobby and LIFT) sites.
- The studies were maintained for the elderly by different organisations.
- US government sites were found to be best at less than 50% (failure, I believe).
- Designing a Touch Screen Kiosk for Older Adults was an example.
- User centered design recommended.

[The original <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Bobby</mark> was a free online tool used to validate websites for WAI and Section 508 compliance. <mark style="background:#BABD00;">LIFT</mark> is a software web analysis engine.]

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Age and Technology Observations:</mark>

Aging is a process of dynamic diversity,

Designing for the aging population requires designing for changing user characteristics,

Flexibility is the key

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction for Blind Computer Users:</mark>

An investigation into accessibility for unsighted users

"Contextualizing Accessibility: Interaction for Blind Computer Users" - Fredrik Winberg

Assistive interfaces as cooperative interfaces.

The ability of unsighted people to communicate with others, both individuals and groups of people, allows the development of a greater sense of community and social networks previously unavailable, which in turn supports overcoming social isolation.

Lack of training and accessible training materials, as well as general lack of access to a lot of information, still stands in the way of giving visually impaired people equal access as sighted people

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interaction for Blind Users - the problem:</mark>

To describe the present situation with the graphical user interface and the major accessibility problems it presents to a blind and visually impaired user, we can divide the problem into three major categories:
- difference in screen reading architecture,
- visual metaphors, and
- mouse-driven control and navigation.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Difference in screen reading architecture</mark>
- When using a text-based system, the information is displayed using plain text, which is easy to interpret by the screen reader and present using speech or Braille.
- However, graphical user interfaces are pixel-based, which means that information is stored and presented on the pixel level and could be very hard to translate to text. This makes it harder for the screen reader to get access and interpret the textual and especially the graphical non-textual information.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Visual metaphors:</mark>
- Instead of using a specialised command language and explicit information, the graphical interface presents information by using familiar objects or visual images. In order to identify an object or recognise an action, you have to actually see it, the possible textual information is often not enough, and the translation to alternative presentation modes is hard.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Mouse-driver control and Navigation:</mark>
- With no visual feedback, navigation with the mouse is hard since the hand/eye coordination that is essential in the use of the mouse does not translate well into speech synthesis or Braille text.
- There is simply no easy way to track the mouse cursor other than to look at the screen.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Screen Readers:</mark>
- Many blind and visually impaired people use a screen reader to access the contents of the computer screen. This is a piece of software that reads the contents of the screen and presents it using synthetic speech or Braille. For example, when browsing a desktop with files and folders, the user steps through the objects line by line, getting their names read out by a speech synthesiser or displayed on a Braille display. In order to access commands, menus and to make simple mouse emulation, the keyboard is used. The mouse is almost never used.

- The major difference between a screen reader and a graphical user interface is the way the information is presented. Plain text is a linear or one-dimensional way of presenting information, information that in the graphical user interface is two or three-dimensional.

- For example, in a desktop file system, like MacOS or Windows, the files and folders are placed on a two dimensional surface, and different windows could be placed on this surface also, both next to each other and partly or totally covering each other.

- When presenting this information using speech synthesis or Braille, this two or three-dimensional information is projected into one dimension. Important spatial information, such as grouping and spatial relationships, gets lost in this transfer when everything has to be presented in a linear fashion

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Screen Reader Problems (OSM)</mark>
- The Off-Screen Model (OSM)

- This is the data structure that the screen reader has to maintain, keeping all the information the screen contains.

- It contains information about what characters are written where on the screen, the different controls that are used and the grouping and the spatial relationship between the different objects.

- The problem with maintaining this model is that it could become outdated if the screen updates without updating the OSM

- Furthermore, the information in the OSM could be insufficient if the application uses non-standardised controls like a picture instead of a button, or presents text that is included in an image instead of using the built in functions in the operating system for writing text.

- In this case, there is no way for the screen reader to recognise that the image is a button or even a string of characters, and the user will miss it entirely.

- Even though the present development of accessibility in modern operating systems has made it easier for screen readers to access the screen contents, there are still problems in representing what is presented on the screen.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles of Universal Design:</mark>

The Seven Principles of Universal Design (to include less abled users)
1.  Equitable use
2. Flexibility in use
3. Simple and Intuitive
4. Perceptible Information
5. Tolerance for Error
6. Low Physical Effort
7. Size and Space (for approach and use

These seven principles may be applied to: evaluating existing designs, guiding the design process and educating both designers and consumers about the characteristics of more usable products and environments.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Beneficiaries of universal design include:</mark>
- People in a noisy shopping mall who cannot hear a kiosk,
- People who are driving their car who must operate their radio or phone without looking at it,
- People who do not have their glasses with them,
- People who are getting older,
- People with disabilities,
- Almost anyone.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BxNXM1p.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 1: Equitable Use:</mark>

The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities

![](https://i.imgur.com/XYslKAB.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 2: Flexibility in Use:</mark>

The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LMnkxSc.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use:</mark>

Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kCnE0Qv.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 4: Perceptible Information:</mark>

The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities

![](https://i.imgur.com/UaSNCEX.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 5: Tolerance for Error:</mark>

The design minimises hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GSqcrkn.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 6: Low Physical Effort:</mark>

The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue

![](https://i.imgur.com/XmRX79Z.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principle 7: Size and Space and Approach and Use:</mark>

Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility

- A review of the principles with examples


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Overview:</mark>

Life cycle models in Human Computer Interfaces

Four basic requirements in HCI:
- Requirements
- Design
- Develop/Build
- Evaluation

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design Model (Revisited):</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/QOd0vvH.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is usability?</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/eDrnJUn.png)


Usability can be defined as:
- “The capacity to be used by humans easily and effectively where;
- easily = to a specified level of subjective assessment
- effectively = to a specified level of human performance”
- (Shackel, 1990)

Usability affords the user easy access to the product’s functions.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Bad usability with major consequences:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/QydEWE6.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">A measure of usability:</mark>

This chart compares the results distribution from both editions of a Usability Return on Investment report. The different case studies are arranged across the horizontal axis (sorted by increasing metric improvements). The vertical axis shows each case study's recorded improvement

![](https://i.imgur.com/So9gsoq.png)

[www.useit.com/alertbox/roi.html](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/roi.html?isPin=false)

It is possible to measure usability in case studies

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Guidelines</mark> are a basis for determining a course of action

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles</mark> are basic rules that guide or influence thoughts or actions

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Theories</mark> (in this context) are general principles that explain or predict facts or events

![](https://i.imgur.com/RtISRxU.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Guidelines:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">With guidelines, an interface designer can:</mark>
- Develop a shared language
- Promote consistency in design
- Record best practices (for reporting)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Android Development User Interface Guidelines:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/0o563Xz.png)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Accessibility:</mark>

Addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">A few of the guidelines:</mark>
- Provide a text equivalent for every non-text (EG graphic) element.
- Ensure that information does not rely on colour perception.
- Avoid causing the screen to flicker
- Provide an auditory description of the visual information in multimedia presentations
- For multimedia, ensure that timing of alternative descriptions is synchronised with the presentation
- Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Facilitating Data Entry:</mark>

Smith and Mosier (1986) offer five high-level objectives as part of their guidelines for data entry:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Consistency</mark> of data-entry transactions
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Minimal input</mark> actions by user
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Minimal memory</mark> load on users
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Compatibility</mark> of data entry with data display
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Flexibility</mark> for user control of data entry

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Principles:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Generally, principles:</mark>
- are more fundamental, widely applicable, and enduring than guidelines,
- are largely independent of technology,
- often need more clarification.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">For any system or product:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles of Universal Design</mark> – can be applied to any system or product used by people.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">For computer systems:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Nielsen’s Usability Principles</mark> – are used mostly as the basis for evaluating prototypes and existing systems.

(Many principles of both are overlapping.)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Evaluations:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">There are advantages and disadvantages of running expert usability evaluations:</mark>
- There can be relatively few ethical and practical issues to consider compared to end user testing
- It can be difficult and expensive to find experts
- The best experts have knowledge of application domain and users

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Biggest problems:</mark>
- Important problems may get missed;
- Many trivial problems are often identified;
- Experts have biases.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluation:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Two types of evaluation:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Formative</mark> evaluation is done at different stages of development to check that the product meets users' needs
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Summative</mark> evaluation assesses the quality of a finished product.

Our focus is on formative evaluation.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">What to evaluate:</mark>

Iterative design and evaluation is a continuous process that examines:
- early ideas for conceptual model,
- early prototypes of the new system,
- later, more complete prototypes.

Designers need to check that they understand users’ requirements.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">When to evaluate:</mark>

- Throughout design?
- From the first descriptions, sketches, etcetera of users needs, through to the final product?
- Design proceeds through iterative cycles of ‘Design-Test-Redesign’.
- Evaluation is a key ingredient for a successful design

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluation Paradigms:</mark>
- Expert Reviews
- Usability Testing
- Survey Instruments
- Acceptance Testing

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Expert Reviews:</mark>

Formal Expert Reviews have proven to be effective.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Expert review methods:</mark>
- Heuristic evaluation
- Guidelines review
- Consistency inspection
- Cognitive walkthrough
- Formal usability inspection

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design Evaluation:</mark>

Interface Design Evaluation Approach

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluate Conceptual Design:</mark>
- Steps in Design
- Theoretical Foundation
- Conceptual Design of Instruct. Strategies

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability:</mark>
- Ease of Use, Ease of Learning
- User Acceptance

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Learning Outcome:</mark>
- Effectiveness

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">User-Centred Evaluation Approach</mark>

Evaluation for testing prototypes, using:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Expert Evaluation:</mark> Heuristics and walk-throughs
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Predictive evaluation:</mark> Testing against an engineering model (E.G. Simulated User)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Empirical evaluation:</mark> Watching users use the product

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Testing:</mark>

Usability Testing involves measuring typical users’ performance on tasks that are typical of those for which the system was designed.

Performance is generally measured in terms of number of errors and time to complete the task

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Forms of usability testing:</mark>
- Paper mockups
- Discount usability testing
- Competitive usability testing
- Universal usability testing
- Field test and portable labs
- Remote usability testing
- ‘Can-you-break-this?’ tests

![](https://i.imgur.com/kch1aAP.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Survey Instruments:</mark>

Written user surveys are a familiar, inexpensive companion for usability tests and expert reviews.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Keys to successful surveys:</mark>
- clear goals in advance,
- development of focused items that help attain the goals.

Online surveys avoid the cost of printing and the extra effort needed for distribution and collection of paper forms.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">The goals would be to ascertain:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Users background</mark> (age, gender, origins, education, income)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Experience with computers</mark> (specific applications or software packages, length of time, depth of knowledge)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Job responsibilities</mark> (decision-making influence, managerial roles, motivation)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personality style</mark> (introvert vs. extrovert, risk taking vs. risk aversive, early vs. late adopter, systematic vs. opportunistic)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Reasons for not using an interface</mark> (inadequate services, too complex, too slow)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Familiarity with features</mark> (printing, macros, shortcuts, tutorials)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Their feeling state after using an interface</mark> (confused vs. clear, frustrated vs. in-control, bored vs. excited)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Acceptance Tests:</mark>

For large implementation projects, the customer usually sets objective and measurable goals for hardware and software performance – E.G.
- Time to learn specific functions
- Speed of task performance
- Rate of errors by users
- Human retention of commands over time
- Subjective user satisfaction

If the completed product fails to meet these acceptance criteria, the system must be reworked until success is demonstrated

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Summary of the lecture:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability</mark> can be defined as the capacity to be used by humans easily and effectively.
- Ease-of-use
- Friendliness

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Guidelines</mark> - provided a number of sample guidelines
<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles</mark> - introduced major principles in HCI
<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluation</mark> - including survey instruments and acceptance testing


#HCI 
### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">The User:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/A8kXcsl.png)

The user is the most important entity of the system
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmfhaBd.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">The Nature of the User:</mark>

- There are many categories of users and it is impossible to consider all of them.
- Can you group users?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4375fTw.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Computer Skills and Knowledge:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nondiscretionary Users:</mark>
- The computer is part of employment  
- Time and effort in learning to use computer are willingly invested  
- A high motivation is often used to overcome low usability characteristics 
- E.G. Flight Reservations Clerk, Programmer, etc.
- TU Dublin Students are non-discretionary users of Brightspace

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Discretionary Users:</mark>
- Are more self-directed, not told how to work 
- It is the result, not the means that are more important  
- Utilisation of the system is not necessary  
- Will not invest extra effort to use the system  
- Do not often show high motivation to use the system  
- Are easily disenchanted

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Impact on Interface Design:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nondiscretionary:</mark>
- Productivity is the most important factor  
- Interface is still important, but the user will be willing to invest time and money for training  
- Niche application area, one type of user

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Discretionary:</mark>
- Interface is extremely important, first impression of the system  
- Must cater for many different user types  
- Must sell your product to user  
- If system is not perceived as achieving results with minimum effort, may be refused

![](https://i.imgur.com/Fqy8af2.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Novice Users:</mark>
- System features should assist recognition memory - menus, prompts, help screen  
- Need restricted vocabularies, simple tasks, small number of possibilities and information feedback  
- View practice as an aid to moving up to expert status

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Expert Users:</mark>
- Rely upon free recall  
- Need less information feedback  
- Seek efficiency by bypassing novice memory aids, reducing keystrokes and summarising   information

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Age:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Young User:</mark>
- Active learners drawing on physical and social experiences 
- Learn by doing  
- Require something that they can see, touch and hear  
- Prior to the age of 8, children rely on visual and auditory perception for knowledge  
- Learning is through first hand experience

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Young User Design Guidelines (Wyeth & Purchase, 2003):</mark>
- Activities are open-ended and discovery-oriented  
- Interaction encourages child-initiated play  
- Involve active manipulation and transformation of real materials  
- Entry-level knowledge and skill is kept to a minimum  
- Provision is made for children’s varied skill and ability levels 
- Construction activities that involve design, creation and evaluation processes form the basis of interactions

![](https://i.imgur.com/hXcj2rs.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Aging User:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/ULSfu91.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Aging User Design Guidelines (Hawthorn, 2003):</mark>
- Simplify screen design  
- Provide users with simple linear search spaces with few options  
- Increase size of fonts and controls  
- Reduce both windows management tasks and scrolling  
- Ensure contrast between text and background  
- Menus can introduce problems, toolbars may be an alternative

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Culture:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cultural and International Diversity:</mark>
- Characters, numerals, special characters, and diacritical's (those that distinguish meanings)  
- Left-to-right versus right-to-left, versus vertical input and reading  
- Date and time formats  
- Numeric and currency formats  
- Weights and measures  
- Telephone numbers and addresses  
- Names and titles (Mr., Ms., Mme.)
- Social-security (USA), national identification (some EU), and passport numbers  
- Capitalisation and punctuation  
- Sorting sequences  
- Icons, buttons, colours  
- Pluralisation, grammar, spelling  
- Etiquette, policies, tone, formality, metaphors

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disabilities:</mark>

Designers must plan early to accommodate users with disabilities.  

Their needs are more critical.  

Disabled users can be categorised as follows:  
- Physically disabled users  
- Cognitively disabled users

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Physically Disabled:</mark>

Impairments can include lack of mobility, low vision, blind and hearing...  

Alternative channels of interactions:  
- Speech recognition  
- Tune recognition  
- Lip-reading  
- Body-electric sensors  

The more sophisticated and complex a system is, the more specialised its target  group gets.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Physically Disabled Design Guidelines (Nielsen, 1995):</mark>

Provide keyboard access to application features  

Follow key-mapping guidelines or the local environment  

Avoid placing frequently used functions deep in a menu structure  

Do not hard-code colours, graphics, or font sizes and styles  

Provide visual information that is redundant with audible information  

Allow users to configure frequency and volume of audible cues

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitively Disabled:</mark>

Examples of cognitive impairments would be learning disabilities, dyslexia and poor memory.  

Changes can be made to accommodate these users by improving layouts, controlling vocabulary, and limiting short-term memory demand.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitively Disabled Design Guidelines (Lewis, 2004):</mark>
- Social inclusion is most important  
- Access to information is critical to social inclusion and increasingly reliant on technology  
- Some research shows that these users have the same problems with web-sites as other users but with greater severity  
- Access to textual information is difficult

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Considerations:</mark>

A vital foundation for HCI designers is an understanding of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">cognitive</mark> and <mark style="background: #BABD00;">perceptual</mark> abilities of the user. 

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognition</mark> is what goes on in our heads when we carry out everyday activities.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive</mark> and <mark style="background: #BABD00;">perceptual abilities</mark>:  

The human ability to interpret sensory input rapidly and to initiate complex actions makes modern computer systems possible.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/WaFii5i.png)

The journal, Ergonomics Abstracts offers this classification of human cognitive processes:
- Long-term and semantic memory  
- Short-term and working memory  
- Problem solving and reasoning  
- Decision making and risk assessment  
- Language communication and comprehension  
- Search, imagery, and sensory memory  
- Learning, skill development, knowledge acquisition and concept attainment

The variety of cognitive attributes have an important influence on screen design.
![](https://i.imgur.com/waKtgHA.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes - Perception:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Perception</mark> is fundamental to interacting with computers.  

To use a computer, a user needs to perceive information that is presented by the interface.  

Perception can involve all the different senses (visual, hearing, touch, smell...)  

To date, HCI is mostly concerned with visual perception, because the computer screen is usually the interface.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WoJkepP.png)

Two classes of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Visual Perception Theory</mark> are:
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive</mark>  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Ecological</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive perception:</mark>
- Anything perceived on a screen is also a result of our prior knowledge and expectations
- Constructivism uses <mark style="background: #BABD00;">context</mark> to interpret and understand what we perceive when we see something.  
- This principle is not initially concerned with specific detail, it relates more to the overall meaning of the scene. That is, it might ‘generalise’ to interpret.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws:</mark>

Visual constructive perception relate to the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws of Perceptual Organisation</mark>.

(Gestalt = shape, and usually a shape made from more that one part).  ‘Laws’ of perception that are regarded as being innate:
- Proximity  
- Similarity  
- Closure  
- Continuity  
- Symmetry

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Proximity:</mark>

Put things close together, and viewers will associate them with one another: strong grouping of content and controls on a UI.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Proximity:</mark> The elements appear as  
groups rather than a  
random cluster of elements

![](https://i.imgur.com/1U2N6zG.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Similarity:</mark>

If two things are the same shape, size, colour, or orientation, for instance, viewers will also associate them with each other.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Similarity:</mark> There is a tendency for elements of the same shape or colour to be seen as belonging together

![](https://i.imgur.com/ahETxmQ.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UzGzuY8.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Closure:</mark>

We want to see simple closed forms, such as rectangles and blobs of whitespace not explicitly drawn for us. Groups of things may appear to be closed forms.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Closure:</mark> Missing parts of the figure are filled in to complete it, so that it appears as a  
whole circle.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Continuity:</mark>

Our eyes want to see continuous lines and curves formed by the alignment of smaller elements.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Continuity:</mark> The stimulus appears to be made of two lines of dots traversing each other, rather than a random set of dots

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ds6Q8xE.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Symmetry:</mark>

Regions bounded by symmetrical borders may be perceived as coherent figures; we perceive symmetrical objects as parts of the same group. They create an impression of stability and order.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Symmetry:</mark> Regions bounded by symmetrical borders tend to be perceived as coherent figures

![](https://i.imgur.com/aV3hla6.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes – Perception (Ecological):</mark>

Ecological theory argues that visual perception is a direct process. That is, perception is made by the observer, specific to them.  
- Information is simply detected, not constructed  
- Ecological theory is not really concerned with how we make sense of a scene, more that the scene has a method of presentation.  
- (How we interpret, how we ‘make sense’, is better related to constructivism.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes – Perception (Ecological) – Affordance:</mark>

A central concept of the ecological approach is the notion of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">affordance</mark>. (This is the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">‘readiness to hand’</mark> that make websites, application interfaces and gadgets physically easier to use.)  
- When the affordance of an object is perceptually obvious (perceptual affordance), it is easy for us to know how to interact with it.  
- When the opposite is true, we tend to make mistakes when trying to interact with the object.

What we see as the behaviour of an interface object is that which is afforded or suggested by the object, (E.G. if the interface object looks like a button it should behave like a button).
- Scroll bars - for many computer users, these are intuitive to dragging upwards/downwards.  
- Door handles - usually have good affordance for pushing or pulling.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Affordance</mark> is very important with regards to interface objects such as buttons, scrollbars etc. (Any direct manipulation systems.)

A button affords being pushed.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes – Perception:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/kGC3db7.png)

One must consider both Constructive and Ecological in screen design.

Techniques used to guide perception  
- Use of icons and graphical representations  
- Use of audible, distinguishable sounds  
- Speech output should enable users to distinguish between a set of spoken words  
- Legible text, and should be distinguishable from its background  
- Use of tactile feedback in virtual environments  
- Use perceptual laws of grouping  
- Use of perceptual boundaries (Windows)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Frameworks:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive frameworks</mark> help us to understand how users become familiar with a system.  

Two common frameworks are:  
- Mental Models  
- Metaphors

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Frameworks – Mental Models:</mark>

Users develop an understanding of a system through learning and using it.  

They develop knowledge of:  
- how to use the system (what to do next)  
- to a lesser extent, how the system works  

People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks.

Mental models can be described as “internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made” or  “the expectations the person has about how things work.”  

In particular:  
- how the computer and its software work  
- the information resources  

People sometimes use erroneous mental models.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Other examples of incorrect mental models:</mark>  
- Pressing the button at pedestrian lights – more presses, ‘the lights will change faster...’  
- Cursor freezes on the computer – press various different types of keys...  
- Hit the television to make it work or stop pixelating...

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Designer's Vs. User's Mental Model:</mark>

One of usability's big dilemmas is the common gap between designers' and users’ mental models.  

Because <mark style="background: #BABD00;">designers</mark> know too much, they form wonderful mental models of their own creations, leading them to believe that each feature is easy to understand. 

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Users'</mark> mental models of the UI are likely to be somewhat more deficient, making it more likely for people to make mistakes and find the design much more difficult to use

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Mismatch:</mark>

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Computer Interaction and Design:</mark>

There may be problems in users’ use of current systems, or the ‘way they see the world’, that might have a negative effect on the design of new systems for users where there is an emphasis on their interaction with these systems. What to do?  
- Identify the potential for problems (E.G. use the 7 Stages of Action Model – Norman’s Model),  
- Look for the gulf between their use an/or their understanding of a system and a better design for a system.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Seven Stages of Action Model (Norman's Model):</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Four principles of good design:</mark>  
1. The state (of the function) and the action alternatives should be visible to the user,  
2. There should be a good conceptual model with a consistent system image,  
3. The interface should include good mappings that reveal the relationships between stages,  
4. The user should receive continuous feedback.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Frameworks – Metaphors:</mark>

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which an expression is used to refer to something that it does not literally denote, in order to suggest a similarity.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Metaphors:</mark>

A <mark style="background: #BABD00;">key issue</mark> in <mark style="background: #BABD00;">software design</mark> is to make the model as clear and comprehensible as possible, and to relate it appropriately to the person's models, based on prior experience with other systems and aspects of ordinary life.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Metaphors</mark> can help the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">designer communicate</mark> the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">mental model</mark>, based on the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">user’s prior understanding</mark>.

A very prevalent metaphor – “the mind is an information processor”.  

Information enters and exits the mind through a series of processing steps.  

The Human Information Processing (HIP) Model, which provides a basis from which to make predictions about human performance, models the cognitive processes of a user interacting with a computer.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Example - Virtual World Metaphor:</mark>


![](https://i.imgur.com/MkVGtBN.png)

A digitised view of a scene can act as a metaphor for the real world scene, and you (as user) can react to the scene according to the metaphor.
