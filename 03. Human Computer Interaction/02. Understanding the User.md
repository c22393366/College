### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Requirements Recap:</mark>

An interactive design may aim to:
- Update or replace an established system
- Develop a totally innovative product

There may be:
- An initial set of requirements or
- The project may have to begin producing a set of requirements from scratch

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Centred Design:</mark>
- Who are the users?
- What activities are being carried out?
- Where is the interaction taking place?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Understanding the User:</mark>

As introduced last week, there are many approaches to understand users using a range of user research methods
- Observation
- Interview
- Questionnaire
- Focus Groups

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quantitative and Qualitative Studies:</mark>

Quantitative and qualitative studies may be useful to the research into understanding users
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quantitative data</mark> - expressed as numbers
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Qualitative data</mark> - difficult to measure sensibly as numbers, e.g. counting the number of words to measure dissatisfaction
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Quantitative analysis</mark> - numerical methods to ascertain size, magnitude, amount
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Qualitative analysis</mark> - Expresses the nature of elements and is represented as themes, patterns, stories
- Be careful how you manipulate data and numbers

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Data Gathering:</mark>

Data gathering is a central part of identifying needs and establishing requirements and of evaluation

Many techniques are available, each has its advantages and disadvantages

What techniques could we use to gather data about user behaviours, needs, etc?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Data Gathering:</mark>

Whatever method is employed, data will need to be recorded:
- Notes
- Audio
- Video
- Photographs
- Analytics

Consent is often required for user research - written, informed consent

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Setting Goals:</mark>

What questions are we trying to answer?

What do we need to know at this point in the UI or UX design process?

What are the gaps in our knowledge that we aim to fill?

"What features do our users value the most?"

"Do our users enjoy using our product?"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Identifying Participants:</mark>

The effort of identifying participants should represent the target users

Participants may be users of the current system or similar (a competitor's system, a new system)

Participants might also be atypical users

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Recruiting Users for Requirements Gathering:</mark>

Who are the users of the system being investigated?

Are they current users of a similar system?

Could there be a number of stakeholders involved?

Could there be different kinds of users? For example, to design a learning tool, you must consider students, lecturers, perhaps administrators

You cannot interview them all but try to find people representative of user groups

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Recruitment Incentives:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Incentives</mark> - recruitment incentives for participants:
- Monetary
- Non-monetary
- Voluntary

Reusing participants can be done, but this should be avoided when evaluating the user's first experience, ease of learning, or multiple iterations of the same design

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Three Main Methods:</mark>

- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Observations

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interviews - Three Types:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Unstructured</mark> - are not directed by a script. Rich but not replicable.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Structured</mark> - are tightly scripted, often like a questionnaire. Replicable but may lack richness

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Semi-structured</mark> - guided by a script but interesting issues can be explored in depth. These can provide a good balance between richness and replicability

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interviews:</mark>

Interviews could be seen as a forum for talking to people

Props. e.g. sample scenarios of use, prototypes, etc can be used in interviews

Interviews are good for exploring issues but are time consuming and it may be unfeasible to visit everyone who is a user

If conducting an interview, think about how you phrase questions:

Are they leading?

Some information may be better gained from observation

Open ended questions can lead to more insightful answers

Don't ask questions that are for the designer, e.g. "How do you think x should be redesigned?"

Ask about user's own preferences and experiences

Be careful of absolute scales, instead ask people to compare the product to something else

Try to avoid Yes/No

Open ended questions are good for the beginning of an interview

Silence is golden, don't jump in. Let participants think about their answers

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interview Questions:</mark>

Two types:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Closed Questions</mark> have a predetermined answer format
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Open questions</mark> do not have a predetermined format

Closed questions are easier to analyse

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Avoid:</mark>
- Long questions
- Compound sentences - "Is this tool interesting and useful?"
- Jargon and language the interviewee may not understand
- Leading questions that make assumptions
- Unconscious biases, e.g. gender stereotypes

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Prompts:</mark>

Think about prompts that you can use if a participant answers with short responses but remember not to lead

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Running the interview:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Introduction</mark> - introduce yourself, explain the goals of the interview, reassure about ethical issues, ask to record, present any informed consent forms

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Warm-up</mark> - make first questions easy and non-threatening

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Main body</mark> - present questions in a logical order

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">cool-off</mark> period - include a few easy questions to defuse tension at the end

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Closure</mark> - thank interviewee, signal the end, e.g. turn off the recorder

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Probing Questions:</mark>

Follow-up questions in user interviews gather more detailed information from participants than they provided in their initial answers to our planned questions.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaires:</mark>

Questionnaires are often presented as a series of questions designed to elicit specific information

Questionnaires are often used in conjunction with other techniques

They can give <mark style="background:#BABD00;">quantitative</mark> or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">qualitative</mark> data

They are useful for answering specific questions from a large, dispersed group of people

Questions can be closed or open

Closed questions are easier to analyse and may be done by computer

Questionnaires can be administered to large populations

Paper, email, web and social networks are used for dissemination

Sampling can be a problem when the size of a population is unknown as is common online

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaire design:</mark>

The impact of a question can be influenced by question order

Do you need different versions of the questionnaire for different populations?

Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire

Strike a balance between using white space and keeping the questionnaire compact

Decide on whether phrases will all be positive, all negative or fixed

Consider starting the questionnaire by asking for demographic information, e.g. age, gender, place of birth, computer proficiency, details of relevant experience, etc

This provides potentially useful context

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Question and Response Format:</mark>

'Yes' and 'No' checkboxes

Scales

![](https://i.imgur.com/HjZuOZO.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Encouraging a good response:</mark>

Make sure the purpose of the study is clear

Promise anonymity

Ensure questionnaire is well designed

Offer a short version for those not able to complete a long questionnaire

Follow up with emails, phone calls, letters

Provide an incentive

40% response rate is high, 20% is often acceptable

Plan accordingly

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaires - Advantages:</mark>

Responses are usually received quickly

Data can be collected in database for analysis

Time required for data analysis is reduced

Errors can be corrected easily

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Questionnaires - Disadvantages:</mark>

Sampling is problematic if population size in unknown

Preventing individuals from responding more than once

Greater potential for abuse

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Observation:</mark>

Observation is about observing people to find a problem or empathise with users

Strategies to observe users will be needed

Ethnography might be important. Also, tacit knowledge, everyday behaviours, intuitions, what is the wider context? How does the technology embed itself into the wider ecology of the user's life

Pay attention to the user's strategies and workarounds

Identify user frustrations

Also errors that users make are important to improving the interface

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Focus group:</mark>

Workshop or focus group:
- Good at gaining a consensus view and/or
- highlighting areas of conflict

"User panels" can be an excellent forum for group activity

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Diary Studies:</mark>

Diary studies capture long term information

These studies record a specific piece of information - could be paper, video, audio

Entry must be as easy as possible

A researcher can follow up and remind users during the study to provide diary entries

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Experience Sampling:</mark>

While researching using Experience Sampling, you can alert participants to give feedback or information at a particular time or location

Experience Sampling might be useful for aggregating information across lots of people

It may be easier for sample data entries to be filled in automatically

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Other Methods:</mark>

Lead Users as collaborative researchers or designers: the researcher/designer can translate an expert user's idea into something more universal

Extreme users: we can learn from the "extremes of use"

Keep real end users in mind: create Personas that contain demographics motivations

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Other approaches to User Requirements:</mark>

Who are the stakeholders?
- Those who are responsible for the UI's design and development,
- Those with a financial interest
- Those responsible for introducing and maintaining the UI in an organisation
- Those who have an interest in its use

You may need to use a particular approach to find this out. Example:
- Cooperative Requirements Capture approach (CRC)
- Structured System Analysis and Design Method (SSADM)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">First</mark> - an investigation of the current environment (developing a logical picture of present activities and future needs)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Second</mark> - alternative courses of actions are derived for the Project Manager to select from (Business system options)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">SSADM</mark> is largely a process-oriented and data-oriented approach

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Task Analysis:</mark>

Task analysis could be seen as the study of what a user is required to do, in terms of actions and/or cognitive processes, to achieve a system goal

It is "an umbrella term that covers techniques for investigating cognitive processes and physical actions, at a high level of abstraction and in minute detail"

Task Analysis models how the user would use a system
- What should be added?
- Where do new features fit?
- What can be left out?
- What's most critical?
- What's most frequently done?

It may help to choose a high-level interaction or think about a conceptual model

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">goal</mark> can be defined as something the user wishes to achieve.

The goal can be, for example, writing a letter, making an order, depositing money

To reach a goal the user usually needs a plan which involves a set of tasks to be performed in order to reach a goal

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">task</mark> is the series or activities or actions required to achieve a goal.

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">task</mark> is a structured set of activities. The task can involve problem solving or selecting between alternative actions

An <mark style="background:#BABD00;">action</mark> is a simple task which requires no problem solving. An action has no structure.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Hierarchical Task Analysis:</mark>

Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) focuses on physical and observable actions and includes looking at actions not related to software or an interaction device

HTA starts with a user goal which is examined and the main tasks for achieving it are identified

These tasks are then divided into sub-tasks

![](https://i.imgur.com/n4mtQeY.png)


### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Limitations of HTA:</mark>

Real tasks are often very complex

Real problems become too big and complex to analyse and describe

There is a limit to the sort of task that can be modelled

Tasks that overlap each other or are done in parallel are hard to describe, as well as interruptions in the task or unusual flows in the task

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Alternatives to Task Analysis:</mark>

Alan Cooper argued that the most important part of interaction design is not the task but the user's goals

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">goal</mark> is a final state

A <mark style="background:#BABD00;">task</mark>, on the other hand, is a process in-between, which is required to achieve the goal. A focus on the task can result in a design that supports tasks that are not essential to the user or are not designed properly

A proper analysis of the user's goals will lead to the essential tasks, which will give a better and more usable system, according to Cooper. His method to achieve this is called goal-directed design. An important ingredient is also to describe the user as a <mark style="background:#BABD00;">persona</mark>

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personas:</mark>

A persona is a model of a user that focuses on the individual's goals when using an artefact

The model has a specific purpose as a tool for software and product design

The persona model resembles classical user profiles, but with some important distinctions. It is an archetypal representation of real or potential users. It's not a description of a real, single user or average user.

The persona represents patterns of user's behaviour, goals and motives, compiled in a fictional description of a single individual. It also contains made-up personal details, in order to make the persona more "tangible and alive" for the development team

Not necessarily a real person

Use this as a surrogate user

Details matter, they make the person "real"

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Example persona:</mark>

- Betty is 37 years old. She has been Warehouse Manager for five years, and worked for Simpson Brothers Engineering for twelve years. She did not go to university, but has studied on evening classes for a business diploma. She has two children aged 15 and 11, and does not like to work late. She did part of an introductory in-house computer course some years ago, but it was interrupted when she was promoted and could no longer afford the time to study. Her vision is perfect, but her right-hand movement is slightly restricted following an industrial accident 3 years ago. She is enthusiastic about her work and is happy to delegate responsibility and take suggestions from her staff. However, she does feel threatened by the introduction of yet another new computer system (- the third in her time at Simpson Brothers Eng.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personas vs User Profiles:</mark>

Cooper's personas are very different to user profiles which are trying to capture the average or generic user

Instead, his personas are like characters that can interact together to depict user goals

There is a risk that designers may make up characters without basing them on real users

Also, they may represent "extreme users"

You also need to think of "average" target users
