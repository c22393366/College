### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">What is usability?</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/eDrnJUn.png)


Usability can be defined as:
- “The capacity to be used by humans easily and effectively where;
- easily = to a specified level of subjective assessment
- effectively = to a specified level of human performance”
- (Shackel, 1990)

Usability affords the user easy access to the product’s functions.

It is possible to measure usability in case studies

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Guidelines</mark> are a basis for determining a course of action

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles</mark> are basic rules that guide or influence thoughts or actions

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Theories</mark> (in this context) are general principles that explain or predict facts or events

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Guidelines:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">With guidelines, an interface designer can:</mark>
- Develop a shared language
- Promote consistency in design
- Record best practices (for reporting)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Android Development User Interface Guidelines:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Accessibility:</mark>

Addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">A few of the guidelines:</mark>
- Provide a text equivalent for every non-text (EG graphic) element.
- Ensure that information does not rely on colour perception.
- Avoid causing the screen to flicker
- Provide an auditory description of the visual information in multimedia presentations
- For multimedia, ensure that timing of alternative descriptions is synchronised with the presentation
- Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Facilitating Data Entry:</mark>

Smith and Mosier (1986) offer five high-level objectives as part of their guidelines for data entry:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Consistency</mark> of data-entry transactions
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Minimal input</mark> actions by user
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Minimal memory</mark> load on users
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Compatibility</mark> of data entry with data display
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Flexibility</mark> for user control of data entry

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Principles:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Generally, principles:</mark>
- are more fundamental, widely applicable, and enduring than guidelines,
- are largely independent of technology,
- often need more clarification.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">For any system or product:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Principles of Universal Design</mark> – can be applied to any system or product used by people.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">For computer systems:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Nielsen’s Usability Principles</mark> – are used mostly as the basis for evaluating prototypes and existing systems.

(Many principles of both are overlapping.)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Evaluations:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">There are advantages and disadvantages of running expert usability evaluations:</mark>
- There can be relatively few ethical and practical issues to consider compared to end user testing
- It can be difficult and expensive to find experts
- The best experts have knowledge of application domain and users

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Biggest problems:</mark>
- Important problems may get missed;
- Many trivial problems are often identified;
- Experts have biases.

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluation:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Two types of evaluation:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Formative</mark> evaluation is done at different stages of development to check that the product meets users' needs
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Summative</mark> evaluation assesses the quality of a finished product.

Our focus is on formative evaluation.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">What to evaluate:</mark>

Iterative design and evaluation is a continuous process that examines:
- early ideas for conceptual model,
- early prototypes of the new system,
- later, more complete prototypes.

Designers need to check that they understand users’ requirements.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">When to evaluate:</mark>

- Throughout design?
- From the first descriptions, sketches, etcetera of users needs, through to the final product?
- Design proceeds through iterative cycles of ‘Design-Test-Redesign’.
- Evaluation is a key ingredient for a successful design

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluation Paradigms:</mark>
- Expert Reviews
- Usability Testing
- Survey Instruments
- Acceptance Testing

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Expert Reviews:</mark>

Formal Expert Reviews have proven to be effective.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Expert review methods:</mark>
- Heuristic evaluation
- Guidelines review
- Consistency inspection
- Cognitive walkthrough
- Formal usability inspection

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design Evaluation:</mark>

Interface Design Evaluation Approach

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Evaluate Conceptual Design:</mark>
- Steps in Design
- Theoretical Foundation
- Conceptual Design of Instruct. Strategies

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability:</mark>
- Ease of Use, Ease of Learning
- User Acceptance

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Learning Outcome:</mark>
- Effectiveness

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">User-Centred Evaluation Approach</mark>

Evaluation for testing prototypes, using:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Expert Evaluation:</mark> Heuristics and walk-throughs
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Predictive evaluation:</mark> Testing against an engineering model (E.G. Simulated User)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Empirical evaluation:</mark> Watching users use the product

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Usability Testing:</mark>

Usability Testing involves measuring typical users’ performance on tasks that are typical of those for which the system was designed.

Performance is generally measured in terms of number of errors and time to complete the task

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Forms of usability testing:</mark>
- Paper mockups
- Discount usability testing
- Competitive usability testing
- Universal usability testing
- Field test and portable labs
- Remote usability testing
- ‘Can-you-break-this?’ tests

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Survey Instruments:</mark>

Written user surveys are a familiar, inexpensive companion for usability tests and expert reviews.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Keys to successful surveys:</mark>
- clear goals in advance,
- development of focused items that help attain the goals.

Online surveys avoid the cost of printing and the extra effort needed for distribution and collection of paper forms.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">The goals would be to ascertain:</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Users background</mark> (age, gender, origins, education, income)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Experience with computers</mark> (specific applications or software packages, length of time, depth of knowledge)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Job responsibilities</mark> (decision-making influence, managerial roles, motivation)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Personality style</mark> (introvert vs. extrovert, risk taking vs. risk aversive, early vs. late adopter, systematic vs. opportunistic)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Reasons for not using an interface</mark> (inadequate services, too complex, too slow)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Familiarity with features</mark> (printing, macros, shortcuts, tutorials)
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Their feeling state after using an interface</mark> (confused vs. clear, frustrated vs. in-control, bored vs. excited)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Acceptance Tests:</mark>

For large implementation projects, the customer usually sets objective and measurable goals for hardware and software performance – E.G.
- Time to learn specific functions
- Speed of task performance
- Rate of errors by users
- Human retention of commands over time
- Subjective user satisfaction

If the completed product fails to meet these acceptance criteria, the system must be reworked until success is demonstrated
