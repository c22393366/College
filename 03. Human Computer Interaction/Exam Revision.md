### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Centred Design:</mark>

Human-centred design is a creative approach to problem solving that starts with the people that you are designing with and ends with new solutions that are purpose-built to suit their needs.  

Human-centred design is about:
- cultivating deep empathy with the people you’re designing with; generating ideas; building prototypes; 
- sharing what you’ve made together; 
- and eventually, putting your innovative new solution out in the world.  

Users should be involved throughout design and development.  

Iteration is needed throughout.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">HCI Disciplines:</mark>

The disciplines associated with HCI include:  
- Computer Science  
- Psychology  
- Sociology  
- Anthropology  
- Ergonomics  
- Physiology
- Design  
- Art  
- Engineering
- Linguistics  
- Philosophy  
- Artificial Intelligence

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Senses:</mark>

To the user, information can be input or output as:  
- Visual - seeing  
- Auditory - hearing  
- Haptic - touching (and being aware of location)  
- Movement - positioning understood.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Accessibility - Age Related:</mark>

There is a wide variability of mild to moderate sensory, physical and cognitive impairments associated with ageing.  
- Sensory – reduced vision, hearing  
- Physical – reduced mobility, manual dexterity  
- Cognitive – memory issues and cognitive function

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Prototyping:</mark>

Prototyping involves producing an early, inexpensive, and scaled down version of a product in order to reveal any problems with the current design.  

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Low Fidelity Prototyping:</mark>

Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium, E.G. paper, cardboard  

Quick, cheap and easily changed E.G. sketches of screens, task sequences, ‘Post-it’ notes, storyboards, ‘Wizard-of-Oz’

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Low-fidelity Prototyping advantages:</mark>
- Evidence suggests that low fidelity mock-ups are as effective in revealing design flaws as high fidelity mock-ups, at least in this early stage
- Designers/developers are usually happier to discard these designs more readily than a running prototype  
- They are cheaper and quicker to produce  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>  
- Can be difficult to represent details of interface  
- Can be more difficult to convey interaction

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">High-fidelity Prototyping:</mark>  

Uses materials that would be used in the final product  
Prototype looks more like the final system than a low-fidelity version  

Specific development environment is used, e.g. Visual Basic, etc.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">High-fidelity Prototyping advantages:</mark>  
- Possible to create more realistic tasks for evaluation  
- Can represent more detail of screens and interactions.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>  
- Danger that users think they have a full system and may be more reluctant to suggest changes  
- Takes more time to create

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Technology-Driven Project Difference:</mark>

The main difference between Human Centred Design and Technology Driven Design is the focus on either the user or the technology.  

Human Centred Design is more focused on understanding and meeting user needs, while Technology Driven Design is more focused on leveraging the latest technology to create innovative solutions.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Using Personas:</mark>

Personas are a useful tool in a human centred design approach to understand and communicate user needs and requirements.  

If designers want to test potential solutions, but don’t have continuous access to the end-users, they can create fictional characters that can be used to represent a collection of the kinds of people who could be using that potential solution.  

This is called a <mark style="background: #BABD00;">persona</mark>.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Benefits of Using Personas:</mark>

There are many cases where user testing is not possible, so personas are an effective alternative.  

Also even when you have access to real end users, personas can be a great way to translate and communicate user research which can result in more usable designs  

Personas can be used to highlight diversity and present unique user capabilities and preferences  

Encourages user-centred discussions,  

Fosters effective communication in design teams.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Limitations of Using Personas:</mark>

Some researchers have criticised the use of personas by pointing out that conducting research and testing with real end users are preferable to the use of personas.  

Personas have been criticised for trying to describe an “average” user rather than highlighting the diversity of people’s needs, capabilities, circumstances and preferences  

If personas are created based on limited user research, the resulting persona will also be limited in terms of understanding different needs, capabilities and preferences of end users.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Empathy Maps:</mark>

The format varies, but common areas include:
- “Thinking,” - What might your user be thinking? What does this tell you about his or her beliefs?  
- “Saying,” - What are some quotes and defining words your user said?  
- “Doing,” - What actions and behaviours did you notice?  
- “Feeling.” - What emotions might the participant be feeling?

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Usability:</mark>

Usability can be defined as:  

“The capacity to be used by humans easily and effectively where,  
- easily = to a specified level of subjective assessment  
- effectively = to a specified level of human performance”  

Usability affords the user easy access to the product’s functions.  

Usability is generally regarded as ensuring that interactive products are;  
- easy to learn,  
- effective to use and  
- enjoyable from the user’s perspective.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Digital Accessibility:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Digital Accessibility:</mark> addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities.  

Digital accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with technology and  
digital interfaces. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Participatory Design:</mark>

Participatory design involves end-users and stakeholders in the design process. 

The goal of Participatory design is to create products or systems that are more usable, effective, and acceptable to the people who will use them, by incorporating their needs, preferences, and values into the design.

Participatory design typically involves a series of collaborative activities that bring together designers, users, and other stakeholders to co-create and co-
evaluate design solutions. These activities may include interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, and prototyping sessions, among others.

Throughout the process, users and stakeholders are given opportunities to provide feedback, suggest ideas, and contribute to the design decisions.  

The benefits of Participatory design include increased user satisfaction, better user understanding, increased usability and accessibility, and greater user engagement and ownership of the design. 

By involving end-users and stakeholders in the design process, Participatory design can also lead to more innovative and creative solutions that better address real-world problems.

Understand how to design interactive products that fit with what people want, need and may desire,  

Appreciate that one size does not fit all e.g., teenagers are very different to grown-ups,  

Identify any incorrect assumptions they may have about particular user groups e.g., not all older people want or need big fonts,  

Gives awareness of both people’s sensitivities and their capabilities,  

Gives realistic expectations - fewer surprises, less disappointment.  

Timely training may be organised.  

Makes the users active stakeholders.  

Users more likely to forgive or accept problems.  

Can make a big difference to acceptance and success of product.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes - Perception (Ecological) - Affordance:</mark>

A central concept of the ecological approach is the notion of affordance. (This is the ‘readiness to hand’ that make websites, application interfaces and gadgets physically easier to use.)  

When the affordance of an object is perceptually obvious (perceptual affordance), it is easy for us to know how to interact with it.  

When the opposite is true, we tend to make mistakes when trying to interact with the object.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Mental Models:</mark>

Users develop an understanding of a system through learning and using it.  

They develop knowledge of how to use the system (what to do next) and, to a lesser extent, how the system works.  

People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks.  

Mental models can be described as “internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made” or “the expectations the person has about how things work.”  

In particular, how the computer and its software work and the information resources that are included in a system.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Erroneous Mental Models:</mark>

People sometimes use erroneous mental models. 

Example:  
- You arrive home on a cold winter’s night to a cold house. How do you get the house to warm up as quickly as possible?  
- Set the thermostat to be at its highest?  
- Set the thermostat to the desired temperature?  

Typically, people select to set the heat to its highest setting to “get it to heat up as fast as possible”.  
However, the thermostat will not heat any faster at a higher setting - erroneous mental model.

Other examples of incorrect mental models:  
- Pressing the button at pedestrian lights – more presses, ‘the lights will change faster...’  
- Cursor freezes on the computer – press various different types of keys...  
- Hit the television to make it work or stop pixelating...

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Mental Models and Metaphors:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Mental Model:</mark> 

A mental model is a dynamic mental representation of some aspect of the world which a person constructs from experience and instruction.  

Mental Models help to explain the human ability to:  
- make inferences in complex situations  
- predict future states  
- understand new situations  

Two types of mental model: Structural model describes how a device or system works; functional model describes how to use a device or system

Mental models help novice computer users in that they can access their mental models and apply them when interacting with unfamiliar systems.  

Mental Models of how interactive devices work may sometimes be incomplete and inaccurate, however, leading to erroneous understanding of a system.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Metaphors:</mark>  

A metaphor is a device for presenting new concepts via a representation of a familiar real-world framework.  

If the objects in an unfamiliar system seem to behave metaphorically, like their counterparts in the real-world, users will use prior knowledge and experience to interact with the system.

Individual users each have their own mental model. 

A mental model is internal to each user's brain, and different users might construct different mental models of the same user interface. Further, one of usability's big dilemmas is the common gap between designers' and users' mental models. 

Because designers know too much, they form wonderful mental models of their own creations, leading them to believe that each feature is easy to understand.  

Users' mental models of the UI are likely to be somewhat more deficient, making it more likely for people to make mistakes and find the design much more difficult to use.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">User Centred Design Project Overview:</mark>

For a project – such as a website to explore users’ experiences and identify any usability issues - the analyst/designer must understand users’ behaviours and needs in an ‘activity context’.  

The designer or group will be assigned an approach: 
- Surveys (in-person, on-line)  
- Interviews (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)  
- Focus groups  
- Direct observation (in the field, in a more controlled environment)  
- Indirect observation (diary studies, activity traces)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">User Centred Design Project Example:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Interviews – advantages:</mark>  
Great way to capture rich qualitative information on a user’s perceptions and experiences...  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>  
Time consuming and can be resource intensive,  
Sometimes users can’t explain critical aspects of their user experience  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Surveys – advantages:</mark>  
Great for demographic information, quantitative information,  
Can be administered to large populations...  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>  
There can be issues with data quality/data accuracy...

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Observation – advantages:  </mark>
Captures tacit knowledge, user behaviours,  
Can measure both qualitative (perceptions, preferences etc) and quantitative measures (task times, task completion, usability scales etc.) ...  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disadvantages:</mark>  
Time consuming and can be resource intensive to run and analyse,  
Care must be taken not to bias participants with tasks or prompts...

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Think Aloud Method:</mark>

In a thinking aloud evaluation, you ask test participants to use the system while continuously thinking out loud — that is, simply verbalizing their thoughts as they move through the user interface.  

This can be difficult for screen-reader users as the audio output from the screen-reader can interfere with the user verbalising their thoughts. 

A retrospective think aloud method could be used to overcome this issue where users complete the task and then recount their thoughts afterwards.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Interviewing - A Case:</mark>

An analyst might be running an in-person interview study with 20 users to understand their perceptions and experiences of using an online banking application. 

The bank may have given a list of questions but as they are not experienced in user research, they are not written in an appropriate format for user interviews.

Problems with questions might be:  
- Leading questions,  
- Questions for the designer,  
- Hypothetical, confusing...  
- Closed questions

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Researching - A Case:</mark>

An analyst/researcher might be conducting a user study to understand accessibility issues and barriers that current users are experiencing with a mobile app. 

The study might need to be conducted within one month and it may be that the researcher has a limited budget to cover travel costs for participants.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Research ideas might relate to:</mark>  
- why each method for the study was chosen, 
- the recruitment strategy for each method.  
- ethical considerations for collecting data for each method,  
- describing the practical measures taken to record the data for each method,  
- describing the type of data that might be collected for each method (E.G. qualitative, quantitative?)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Ethics:</mark> 

Describe to the participant the type of data you will collect for each method  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">qualitative</mark> - interview/observation recording, transcripts, quotes,  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">quantitative</mark> – survey responses, observation – task timings, task completions  
 
Outline any <mark style="background: #BABD00;">ethical considerations</mark> for collecting data for each method – informed consent, careful handling of personal information, potential for bias.  

Describe the practical measures you will take to collect the data for each method – EG data recording – has it been deemed ethical?

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws:</mark>  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Proximity:</mark> EG Dots in a graphic logo appear as groups rather than a random cluster of elements.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Similarity:</mark> EG There is a tendency for elements of the same shape or colour to be seen as belonging together.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Closure:</mark> EG Missing parts of the figure are filled in to complete it, so that a nearly complete hoop appears as a whole circle.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Continuity:</mark> EG The stimulus appears to be made of two lines of dots traversing each other, rather than a random set of dots, looking like a cross.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Symmetry:</mark> EG Regions bounded by symmetrical borders tend to be perceived as coherent figures.  

Human visual perception has many limitations. They should be kept in mind when designing interfaces. 

The Gestalt laws are important as they imply that we decompose or partition images into separate entities that are readily recognisable.  

When designing interfaces and their components we should take this decomposition process into account, if we are to design suitable computer interfaces for humans to use.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Universal Design:</mark>

The Seven Principles of Universal Design and guidelines for their use  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(1.) Equitable use:</mark>  
The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

Real world example: A ramp is useful for a person in a wheelchair, someone pushing a buggy or wheeling luggage.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(2.) Flexibility in use:</mark>  
The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.  

Real world example: Adjustable computer table - The table height can be easily adjusted to suit different user needs.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(3.) Simple and intuitive:</mark>  
Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.  

Real world example: Use of clear icon symbols with corresponding clear text labels.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(4.) Perceptible information:</mark>  

The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.  

Real world example: User of both audio and captions on video.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(5.) Tolerance for error:</mark>  
The design minimises hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. 

Real world example: Undo feature in digital applications  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(6.) Low physical effort:</mark>  
The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.  

Real world example: An automatic door opener can facilitate access to a room or building.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">(7.) Size and space for approach and use:</mark>  
Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.  

Real world example: Height of touchscreen for purchasing rail tickets is at a height that is accessible for people in a standing or seated position.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Universal Design: Visual Impairment</mark>

Allow text to be resized.  
- Have good contrast in colours.  
- Test for colour blindness related issues.  
- Make sure the website works well with screen readers.  
- Use proper alternative attributes.
- Don’t autoplay any sound

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Universal Design: Mobility and Dexterity</mark>

Recognise and prepare for the fact that not everybody will use a mouse.  

Make the website keyboard accessible.  

Increase hit areas of links and buttons.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Universal Design: Cognitive</mark> 

Make it clear where in the website the user is.  

Organize your content correctly & use proper headings.  

Make the text easily scannable.  

Clearly mark links.  

Use lots of images and graphics.  

Don’t autoplay any sound

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Universal Design: Auditory</mark>  

- Provide text captions and subtitles.  
- Don’t rely on sound for indicators.  
- Don’t autoplay any sound.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Novice or Expert:</mark>

Novices users may be learning a skill for the first time.  
They need practice and experience to become experts.  

System features should assist recognition memory - menus, prompts, help screen.  

Novice users need restricted vocabularies, simple tasks, small number of possibilities and information feedback.  

Experts – can perform the task automatically without having to consciously think about each move.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Heuristic Evaluation:</mark>

Heuristic evaluation is a process where experts assess the usability of user interfaces in independent walkthroughs and report issues.  

Evaluators use established heuristics and reveal insights that can help design teams enhance product usability from early in development.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nielsen's Heuristics:</mark>

Nielsen’s Usability Principles (or Heuristics)
1. Visibility of system status  
2. Match between system and the real world  
3. User control and freedom  
4. Consistency and standards  
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall  
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use  
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design  
9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

To apply Nielsen's heuristics in user interface design, designers can use them as a checklist to identify potential usability issues. For example, a designer might evaluate a website using Nielsen's heuristics and identify that the website has poor visibility of system status, inconsistent navigation, and a lack of error prevention.  

To address these issues, the designer will identify solutions to each breach of a heuristic, I.E., they might consider adding visual cues to indicate system status, such as a loading animation or progress bar. 

Or they might standardise the website's navigation and layout to make it more consistent and predictable for users.
