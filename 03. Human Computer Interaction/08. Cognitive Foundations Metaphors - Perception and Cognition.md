#HCI 
### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">The User:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/A8kXcsl.png)

The user is the most important entity of the system
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmfhaBd.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">The Nature of the User:</mark>

- There are many categories of users and it is impossible to consider all of them.
- Can you group users?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4375fTw.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Computer Skills and Knowledge:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nondiscretionary Users:</mark>
- The computer is part of employment  
- Time and effort in learning to use computer are willingly invested  
- A high motivation is often used to overcome low usability characteristics 
- E.G. Flight Reservations Clerk, Programmer, etc.
- TU Dublin Students are non-discretionary users of Brightspace

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Discretionary Users:</mark>
- Are more self-directed, not told how to work 
- It is the result, not the means that are more important  
- Utilisation of the system is not necessary  
- Will not invest extra effort to use the system  
- Do not often show high motivation to use the system  
- Are easily disenchanted

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Impact on Interface Design:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nondiscretionary:</mark>
- Productivity is the most important factor  
- Interface is still important, but the user will be willing to invest time and money for training  
- Niche application area, one type of user

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Discretionary:</mark>
- Interface is extremely important, first impression of the system  
- Must cater for many different user types  
- Must sell your product to user  
- If system is not perceived as achieving results with minimum effort, may be refused

![](https://i.imgur.com/Fqy8af2.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Novice Users:</mark>
- System features should assist recognition memory - menus, prompts, help screen  
- Need restricted vocabularies, simple tasks, small number of possibilities and information feedback  
- View practice as an aid to moving up to expert status

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Expert Users:</mark>
- Rely upon free recall  
- Need less information feedback  
- Seek efficiency by bypassing novice memory aids, reducing keystrokes and summarising   information

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Age:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Young User:</mark>
- Active learners drawing on physical and social experiences 
- Learn by doing  
- Require something that they can see, touch and hear  
- Prior to the age of 8, children rely on visual and auditory perception for knowledge  
- Learning is through first hand experience

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Young User Design Guidelines (Wyeth & Purchase, 2003):</mark>
- Activities are open-ended and discovery-oriented  
- Interaction encourages child-initiated play  
- Involve active manipulation and transformation of real materials  
- Entry-level knowledge and skill is kept to a minimum  
- Provision is made for children’s varied skill and ability levels 
- Construction activities that involve design, creation and evaluation processes form the basis of interactions

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Aging User:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/ULSfu91.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Aging User Design Guidelines (Hawthorn, 2003):</mark>
- Simplify screen design  
- Provide users with simple linear search spaces with few options  
- Increase size of fonts and controls  
- Reduce both windows management tasks and scrolling  
- Ensure contrast between text and background  
- Menus can introduce problems, toolbars may be an alternative

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Culture:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cultural and International Diversity:</mark>
- Characters, numerals, special characters, and diacritical's (those that distinguish meanings)  
- Left-to-right versus right-to-left, versus vertical input and reading  
- Date and time formats  
- Numeric and currency formats  
- Weights and measures  
- Telephone numbers and addresses  
- Names and titles (Mr., Ms., Mme.)
- Social-security (USA), national identification (some EU), and passport numbers  
- Capitalisation and punctuation  
- Sorting sequences  
- Icons, buttons, colours  
- Pluralisation, grammar, spelling  
- Etiquette, policies, tone, formality, metaphors

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disabilities:</mark>

Designers must plan early to accommodate users with disabilities.  

Their needs are more critical.  

Disabled users can be categorised as follows:  
- Physically disabled users  
- Cognitively disabled users

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Physically Disabled:</mark>

Impairments can include lack of mobility, low vision, blind and hearing...  

Alternative channels of interactions:  
- Speech recognition  
- Tune recognition  
- Lip-reading  
- Body-electric sensors  

The more sophisticated and complex a system is, the more specialised its target  group gets.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Physically Disabled Design Guidelines (Nielsen, 1995):</mark>

Provide keyboard access to application features  

Follow key-mapping guidelines or the local environment  

Avoid placing frequently used functions deep in a menu structure  

Do not hard-code colours, graphics, or font sizes and styles  

Provide visual information that is redundant with audible information  

Allow users to configure frequency and volume of audible cues

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitively Disabled:</mark>

Examples of cognitive impairments would be learning disabilities, dyslexia and poor memory.  

Changes can be made to accommodate these users by improving layouts, controlling vocabulary, and limiting short-term memory demand.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitively Disabled Design Guidelines (Lewis, 2004):</mark>
- Social inclusion is most important  
- Access to information is critical to social inclusion and increasingly reliant on technology  
- Some research shows that these users have the same problems with web-sites as other users but with greater severity  
- Access to textual information is difficult

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Considerations:</mark>

A vital foundation for HCI designers is an understanding of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">cognitive</mark> and <mark style="background: #BABD00;">perceptual</mark> abilities of the user. 

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognition</mark> is what goes on in our heads when we carry out everyday activities.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive</mark> and <mark style="background: #BABD00;">perceptual abilities</mark>:  

The human ability to interpret sensory input rapidly and to initiate complex actions makes modern computer systems possible.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/WaFii5i.png)

The journal, Ergonomics Abstracts offers this classification of human cognitive processes:
- Long-term and semantic memory  
- Short-term and working memory  
- Problem solving and reasoning  
- Decision making and risk assessment  
- Language communication and comprehension  
- Search, imagery, and sensory memory  
- Learning, skill development, knowledge acquisition and concept attainment

The variety of cognitive attributes have an important influence on screen design.
![](https://i.imgur.com/waKtgHA.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes - Perception:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Perception</mark> is fundamental to interacting with computers.  

To use a computer, a user needs to perceive information that is presented by the interface.  

Perception can involve all the different senses (visual, hearing, touch, smell...)  

To date, HCI is mostly concerned with visual perception, because the computer screen is usually the interface.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WoJkepP.png)

Two classes of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Visual Perception Theory</mark> are:
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive</mark>  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Ecological</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive perception:</mark>
- Anything perceived on a screen is also a result of our prior knowledge and expectations
- Constructivism uses <mark style="background: #BABD00;">context</mark> to interpret and understand what we perceive when we see something.  
- This principle is not initially concerned with specific detail, it relates more to the overall meaning of the scene. That is, it might ‘generalise’ to interpret.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws:</mark>

Visual constructive perception relate to the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws of Perceptual Organisation</mark>.

(Gestalt = shape, and usually a shape made from more that one part).  ‘Laws’ of perception that are regarded as being innate:
- Proximity  
- Similarity  
- Closure  
- Continuity  
- Symmetry

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Proximity:</mark>

Put things close together, and viewers will associate them with one another: strong grouping of content and controls on a UI.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Proximity:</mark> The elements appear as  
groups rather than a  
random cluster of elements

![](https://i.imgur.com/1U2N6zG.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Similarity:</mark>

If two things are the same shape, size, colour, or orientation, for instance, viewers will also associate them with each other.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Similarity:</mark> There is a tendency for elements of the same shape or colour to be seen as belonging together

![](https://i.imgur.com/ahETxmQ.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UzGzuY8.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Closure:</mark>

We want to see simple closed forms, such as rectangles and blobs of whitespace not explicitly drawn for us. Groups of things may appear to be closed forms.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Closure:</mark> Missing parts of the figure are filled in to complete it, so that it appears as a  
whole circle.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Continuity:</mark>

Our eyes want to see continuous lines and curves formed by the alignment of smaller elements.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Continuity:</mark> The stimulus appears to be made of two lines of dots traversing each other, rather than a random set of dots

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ds6Q8xE.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive Visual Perception - Symmetry:</mark>

Regions bounded by symmetrical borders may be perceived as coherent figures; we perceive symmetrical objects as parts of the same group. They create an impression of stability and order.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Symmetry:</mark> Regions bounded by symmetrical borders tend to be perceived as coherent figures

![](https://i.imgur.com/aV3hla6.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes – Perception (Ecological):</mark>

Ecological theory argues that visual perception is a direct process. That is, perception is made by the observer, specific to them.  
- Information is simply detected, not constructed  
- Ecological theory is not really concerned with how we make sense of a scene, more that the scene has a method of presentation.  
- (How we interpret, how we ‘make sense’, is better related to constructivism.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes – Perception (Ecological) – Affordance:</mark>

A central concept of the ecological approach is the notion of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">affordance</mark>. (This is the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">‘readiness to hand’</mark> that make websites, application interfaces and gadgets physically easier to use.)  
- When the affordance of an object is perceptually obvious (perceptual affordance), it is easy for us to know how to interact with it.  
- When the opposite is true, we tend to make mistakes when trying to interact with the object.

What we see as the behaviour of an interface object is that which is afforded or suggested by the object, (E.G. if the interface object looks like a button it should behave like a button).
- Scroll bars - for many computer users, these are intuitive to dragging upwards/downwards.  
- Door handles - usually have good affordance for pushing or pulling.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XfwlDTG.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Affordance</mark> is very important with regards to interface objects such as buttons, scrollbars etc. (Any direct manipulation systems.)

A button affords being pushed.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes – Perception:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/kGC3db7.png)

One must consider both Constructive and Ecological in screen design.

Techniques used to guide perception  
- Use of icons and graphical representations  
- Use of audible, distinguishable sounds  
- Speech output should enable users to distinguish between a set of spoken words  
- Legible text, and should be distinguishable from its background  
- Use of tactile feedback in virtual environments  
- Use perceptual laws of grouping  
- Use of perceptual boundaries (Windows)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Frameworks:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive frameworks</mark> help us to understand how users become familiar with a system.  

Two common frameworks are:  
- Mental Models  
- Metaphors

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Frameworks – Mental Models:</mark>

Users develop an understanding of a system through learning and using it.  

They develop knowledge of:  
- how to use the system (what to do next)  
- to a lesser extent, how the system works  

People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks.

Mental models can be described as “internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made” or  “the expectations the person has about how things work.”  

In particular:  
- how the computer and its software work  
- the information resources  

People sometimes use erroneous mental models.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EJPzk3g.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Other examples of incorrect mental models:</mark>  
- Pressing the button at pedestrian lights – more presses, ‘the lights will change faster...’  
- Cursor freezes on the computer – press various different types of keys...  
- Hit the television to make it work or stop pixelating...

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Designer's Vs. User's Mental Model:</mark>

One of usability's big dilemmas is the common gap between designers' and users’ mental models.  

Because <mark style="background: #BABD00;">designers</mark> know too much, they form wonderful mental models of their own creations, leading them to believe that each feature is easy to understand. 

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Users'</mark> mental models of the UI are likely to be somewhat more deficient, making it more likely for people to make mistakes and find the design much more difficult to use

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Mismatch:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/MxgZnUs.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Computer Interaction and Design:</mark>

There may be problems in users’ use of current systems, or the ‘way they see the world’, that might have a negative effect on the design of new systems for users where there is an emphasis on their interaction with these systems. What to do?  
- Identify the potential for problems (E.G. use the 7 Stages of Action Model – Norman’s Model),  
- Look for the gulf between their use an/or their understanding of a system and a better design for a system.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Seven Stages of Action Model (Norman's Model):</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/hisnOzg.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/LhZ9OC6.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Four principles of good design:</mark>  
1. The state (of the function) and the action alternatives should be visible to the user,  
2. There should be a good conceptual model with a consistent system image,  
3. The interface should include good mappings that reveal the relationships between stages,  
4. The user should receive continuous feedback.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Frameworks – Metaphors:</mark>

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which an expression is used to refer to something that it does not literally denote, in order to suggest a similarity.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sKgJgmf.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Metaphors:</mark>

A <mark style="background: #BABD00;">key issue</mark> in <mark style="background: #BABD00;">software design</mark> is to make the model as clear and comprehensible as possible, and to relate it appropriately to the person's models, based on prior experience with other systems and aspects of ordinary life.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Metaphors</mark> can help the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">designer communicate</mark> the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">mental model</mark>, based on the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">user’s prior understanding</mark>.

A very prevalent metaphor – “the mind is an information processor”.  

Information enters and exits the mind through a series of processing steps.  

The Human Information Processing (HIP) Model, which provides a basis from which to make predictions about human performance, models the cognitive processes of a user interacting with a computer.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gu0Q6rj.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Example - Virtual World Metaphor:</mark>


![](https://i.imgur.com/MkVGtBN.png)

A digitised view of a scene can act as a metaphor for the real world scene, and you (as user) can react to the scene according to the metaphor.
