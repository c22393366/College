Our user research showed that many people were dissatisfied with examinations.ie overall. The main issues came from accessibility concerns, poor performance and optimisation, complex navigability, and inconsistent aesthetics on the site.

#### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Accessibility:</mark>
Users who were dyslexic struggled with the small text and green text on a green background e.g. the navbar. The Irish and English versions of the site also differ.
#### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Poor performance and optimisation:</mark>
The website is slow and often has points where it refreshes entirely based on user input. This disproportionately impacts users with slow internet and those in rural and lower-income areas. 

The site also formats very poorly on mobile (see below), which more students have access to than laptops.

#### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Navigation:</mark>
Navigating the page to find a single exam paper takes eleven clicks with perfect input. This is time and energy-consuming for the user.
#### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Inconsistent aesthetics:</mark>
The site initially seems to have a consistent design. The background is white and the menu and titles use a light green background with dark green text. However, the use of so many different shades of green, as well as intense and complete shades of blue, red and yellow is quite overwhelming and unpleasant to the user.

# <mark style="background: #69E772;">B. Problem Statement:</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Problem Context:</mark>
[examinations.ie](https://examinations.ie) is a website belonging to the State Exams Commission (SEC), a branch of the Irish Department of Education. It hosts exam papers and marking schemes for all second level state examination that have been digitised.  It also contains information about the SEC, methods to contact them and general information. The website design is outdated and difficult to use. The website is hostile to those with learning disabilities, people who are unfamiliar with the complex Irish exam system and young people in general. 

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Why it matters:</mark>
According to [this report](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/289901/66bf9068-8a83-4bf8-86d4-d3aba60ef7d1.pdf#page=null) published by the Central Statistics Office, there are currently over 405,000 people enrolled in secondary school in Ireland. At least half of them (3rd year, 5th year and 6th year students) must make use of past papers while studying and the current implementation is not fit for purpose. Physical versions of past papers and third party vendors provide a better vehicle for accessing the documentation and this disadvantages people who cannot spend â‚¬80 or more on physical papers. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide equal access to education, which cannot be achieved when free, high-quality resources are not provided to all. 
##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Aims and objectives:</mark>
The aim is to create a website with user-friendly design and consistent style that keeps the volume of information on the site. The website layout will be simplified and accessibility will be improved. Ideally, the user-experience would improve overall and the site would be fit for purpose.

| **Visibility of System Status**                  | 6        | There is responsiveness when hovering over clickable links                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Match Between the System and Real World**      | 8        | Uses natural language associated with the topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **User Control and Freedom**                     | 4        | Mistakes can lead to a lot of backtracking and unintentional refreshing                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Consistency and Standards**                    | 3        | Very inconsistent layout. Design style changes drastically between sections. Some buttons are unclickable, some elements look like buttons but are not. Colour scheme is not red-green colour-blind friendly. Irish language version of the site still has English posters. |
| **Error Prevention**                             | 2        | Very easy to get lost and make mistakes while navigating. No warnings or explanations for people unfamiliar with the website.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Recognition rather than Recall**               | 2        | Very few symbols used to indicate usage. The most used and important site feature (Exam Material Archive) is not highlighted given priority on the home page. It is hidden in a small, unassuming navbar                                                                    |
| **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**            | 5        | No dark mode, the Irish language version is poorly implemented. Buttons are small. Formats badly on mobile.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**              | 3        | Poorly implemented. The background colour and text colour on the nav bar are very similar. The button colours are garish and contrast poorly with the rest of the page.                                                                                                     |
| **Help Users Diagnose, and recover from Errors** | 3        | When going through a multi-step process any adjustments cause the page to reset and all progress to be lost                                                                                                                                                                 |

This prototype was made using Microsoft Whiteboard.

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Significant Changes: </mark>
- Navbar position
- Content layout
- Unchanged areas
- Minimalistic Design
- Colour Scheme
- Exam Archive Changes
- Changes that cannot be presented by a paper prototype

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Navbar:</mark>
The navbar now sits at the top of the page instead of at the side. This is a slightly more common layout and will be less daunting to younger users.  

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Content Layout:</mark>
The content now spans the width of the page and no longer suffers from the clutter of the sidebar. The 18 items of the original site have been compressed into 5 in the prototype.
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/HxJHMop.png)

The following headings are in the prototype and subsume the previous hedings.

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Home:</mark>
- SEC Home
- About Us
- Statistics
- Recruitment

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Exams:</mark>
- Exam Information
- Exam Material Archive

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Legal:</mark>
- Customer Charter
- Child Safeguarding and Welfare
- Freedom of Information
- Data Protection
- Disability Act
- Contact Directory

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Help:</mark>
- Useful Links
- Schools
- Candidates
- Information for Contract Staff
- Help

<mark style="background: #69E772;">Contact:</mark>
- Contact Directory
- Press Office
##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Minimalistic Design:</mark>
The clutter of the previous design has been replaced with a minimalistic design with consistent spacing. There will be obvious headers and left-aligned spacing to be more conventional. The text and buttons are larger. The unclickable arrows have been removed. 
##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Colour Scheme:</mark>
The colour scheme has been reduced to three colours: White for text, black for the background and green for highlights. The black and white can be inverted by the user between light and dark mode. It is important in modern websites to have a toggle between light mode and dark mode for accessibility purposes. Users spend a long time on the site and dark mode is easier on the eyes and a device's battery life. 

The previous colour scheme of dark green, light green, dark blue, light blue, red, yellow, white and black was garish and unpleasant. It was important to remove the red as the current site contains many different shades of green. Given that around 4.5% of the population are red-green colour blind, this was an important accessibility consideration.

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Exam Archive Changes:</mark>
The Exam archive is the most used feature of the page and is not implemented well. For every selection that is made, the entire page reloads before you can make your next choice.

You must choose between exam papers or marking schemes, then choose a single year, then Leaving cert or Junior cert, then the subject.
![|250](https://i.imgur.com/qYIPa8K.png)

The prototype streamlines this:
![|350](https://i.imgur.com/ZbFmJE9.png)

The prototype requires only the set of exams (Leaving Cert or Junior Cert), and a subject for a search to occur. It will always show the exam papers and the marking schemes as these are commonly used simultaneously by students. The separation of Exam Papers and Marking Schemes is a pain point for a lot of examinations.ie users. 

The option to search by year or year range is available. The current site iteration only allows a search by a single year. This is inconvenient for students as they often wish to have access to multiple past papers at once. 

The Level, e.g. Higher Level, Ordinary Level, Foundation Level and Common Level is now available to be filtered by so that students can search for only the level that they study at. 

The Language version is another optional filter that users can apply because of the Gaelscoil/English school spilt. If a student has no proficiency in one of those languages, filtering by language version can remove bloat from the results.

By allowing the user to structure the way they search for exams, it gives them more control over the results that they see.
##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Changes that cannot be presented by a paper prototype:</mark>
- Dark mode and Light mode.
- Consistency between English and Gaelige versions of the site.
- Posters and images now have writing in Irish on the Gaelige version of the site.
- Website no longer refreshes with each selection in a dropdown menu.
- User mistakes will not have as many loading-time related consequences.
- Site now has an in-built pdf viewer (similar to Brightspace) so that students do not have to download all the papers just to view them.

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Unchanged Areas:</mark>
- The language used is a match with the real exam terminology and is not overly complicated.
- The text changing colour when hovering over links and buttons is a key responsivity feature.
- The SEC logo is recognisable and should not be redesigned.
- The ability to download the papers as pdfs.

# <mark style="background: #69E772;">E. My User test:</mark>

I asked two people who used the examinations.ie website to provide feedback on the prototype: RuÃ¡n and Ethan.

Given their familiarity with the site I first asked them to evaluate the prototype in contrast to examinations.ie. I also asked them what their largest pain point was with examinations.ie.
##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">RuÃ¡n's Evaluation:</mark>
- The dark mode was a badly needed change
- The new search system is sophisticated enough to eliminate the need to purchase third party physical copies. It allows students to be on a more equal playing field, which is something that a government-funded educational website should focus on.
- **Pain Point:** The lack of mobile support was something I really struggled with. We had no laptops in school and the mobile format was nigh-impossible to use since there was no proper changes between laptop and mobile to allow for proper usability.

##### <mark style="background: #69E772;">Ethan's Evaluation:</mark>
- The consistency of the prototype's layout is good. You can tell it was designed with a cohesive purpose and makes navigation easier, unlike the inconsistencies in the previous site.
- The current website is very hard to navigate for users unfamiliar with the exams system and the prototype is more accessible design.
- **Pain Point:** Navigating the page to find any of the papers was not easy for me and I needed help the first few times I used it.. It was too difficult a design to expect teenagers unfamiliar with technology to use.
