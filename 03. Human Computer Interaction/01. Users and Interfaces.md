### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">HCI:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</mark> is the study of the interaction between people, computers and tasks and involves the <mark style="background:#BABD00;">development</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">application</mark> of <mark style="background:#BABD00;">principles</mark>, <mark style="background:#BABD00;">guidelines</mark> and <mark style="background:#BABD00;">methods</mark> to support the design and evaluation of interactive systems

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Overview: Map of HCI:</mark>

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The interdisciplinary nature of HCI:</mark>

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Computer Science and Engineering:</mark>
- For faster machines
- For faster systems
- As a means of building better interfaces

 <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Psychology:</mark>
- To better understand the user
- For modelling the user (as a thinking entity)

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Sociology:</mark>
- For group work and groupware

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Anthropology and Ergonomics:</mark>
- For body shape and equipment design

 <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Physiology:</mark>
- For physical capabilities

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design:</mark>
- For user interface layout

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Art:</mark>
- For aesthetics

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Linguistics:</mark>
- For the language of commands

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Philosophy:</mark>
- To allow for contextual consistency

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Artificial Intelligence:</mark>
- For modelling the user (in relation to software)


###  <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Human of HCI:</mark>

To the user, information is input and output as:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Visual</mark> - seeing
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Auditory</mark> - hearing
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Haptic</mark> - touching and being aware of location
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Movement</mark> - positioning

To the user, information is stored in memory:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Sensory memory</mark> - visual, auditory and tactile
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Short-term memory</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Long-term memory</mark>

To the user, information is processed and applied with:
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Reasoning</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Problem solving</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Skill</mark>
- <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Error</mark>

Emotion influences human capabilities

As HCI designers, engineers and programmers we must remember that <mark style="background:#BABD00;">each person is different</mark>

Other considerations for the user:
- Motivation
- Enjoyment
- Satisfaction
- Experience level

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Computer in HCI:</mark>

There are a huge range of computers and types of applications - HCI is a concern for all of them

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">The System:</mark>
- PCs
- Nuclear Systems
- Laptops

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Use and Context of Computers:</mark>

Problems of fitting together computers, their uses, and the context of use:

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Social organisation and work:</mark>

Where humans are interacting social beings

Considers models of human activity e.g. small groups, organisations, socio-technical systems, etc.

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Application areas:</mark>

With characteristics of application domains, e.g. individual versus group work

May have popular styles in:
- Document production
- Communications
- Design
- Tutorials
- Etc

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The "Human-Machine fit" and adaptation:</mark>

To improve the fit between the designed object and its use

How systems are selected and adopted

How users improvise routine systems

How systems adapt to the user (customisation)

How users adapt to the system (training, ease of learning)

User guidance (help, documentation, error handling)

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">The Interaction of HCI:</mark>

The <mark style="background:#BABD00;">PROCESS</mark>

To understand HCI, we need to understand computers and the processes associated with their systems

<mark style="background:#BABD00;">Interacting with computers:</mark>

Some years ago (50-60), computers performed batch processing.

Punched card stacks or large data stacks were prepared. There was a long wait, line printer output and if it was not right, you would have to start again

These days, most computing is interactive:
- Rapid feedback
- The user in control (most of the time)
- 'doing rather than thinking'

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Design for interactivity:</mark>

An interactive design may aim to <mark style="background:#BABD00;">update</mark> or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">replace</mark> an established system or <mark style="background:#BABD00;">develop</mark> a totally innovative product

There may be an initial set of requirements or the project may have to begin producing a set of requirements from scratch

Regardless of the initial situation, the following must be discussed, refined, clarified and probably rescoped:
- The aim of the project
- Users needs
- Requirements
- Users' aspirations and expectations

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">User Requirements:</mark>

Design for interactivity requires an understanding of:
- the users
- the current tasks
- the goals
- conditions under which the product will be used
- constraints on the products performance

To specify and design a "<mark style="background:#BABD00;">usable</mark>" interface, the software designer must develop an understanding of the user, what they want and what they will do as a result of the proposed system

This is a complex problem with many questions

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">A need to understand users:</mark>

In order to achieve "good" UI design, participation in the process of understanding users and evolving requirements is essential. 

In order to design an effective UI, basic questions should be answered:
- Who is the user?
- What is the interaction taking place?
- What is the task?
- What is the environment in which the system will operate?

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Understanding the User:</mark>

There are many approaches to understand users using a range of user research methods:
- Observation
- Interview
- Questionnaire
- Focus Groups

### <mark style="background:#BABD00;">Lecture Summary:</mark>
