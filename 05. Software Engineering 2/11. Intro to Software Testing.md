### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Role of Testing:</mark>

Testing is basic to every engineering discipline
- Design a drug
- Manufacture an airplane
- Etc.

Why?
- Because our ability to predict how our creations will behave is imperfect
- We need to check our work, because we will make mistakes

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Testing and development of Software</mark>

In what way is software different?

Folklore:
- “Optimism is the occupational hazard of programming; testing is the treatment”
- The implication is that programmers make poor testers

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Why Test?</mark>

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Software Development Today:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/gh3n4YQ.png)


### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Key Assumptions:</mark>

- Human organizations need decision makers to manage (finite) resources (including time)
- Development and testing must be independent

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Independent Testing:</mark>

Programmers have a hard time believing they made a mistake

Plus a vested interest in not finding mistakes

Design and programming are constructive tasks. Testers must seek to break the software

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Wrong Conclusions:</mark>
- The developer should not be testing at all (Recall “test before you code”)
- Testers only get involved once software is done
- Toss the software over the wall for testing(Testers and developers collaborate in developing the test suite)
- Testing team is responsible for assuring quality (Quality is assured by a good software process)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">The Purpose of Testing:</mark> 

Two purposes:
- Find bugs. Find important bugs.
- Elucidate the specification: When testing the prototype or strawman

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Example:</mark>

Test case: Add a child to Mary Brown’s record

- Version 1
	- Check that Ms. Brown’s # of children is one more
- Version 2
	- Also check Mr. Brown’s # of children
- Version 3
	- Check that no one else’s child counts changed

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Specifications:</mark>

- Good testers clarify the specification: This is creative, hard work
- There is no hope tools will automate this: This part will stay hard work

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Testing Strategies:</mark>

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Unit tests:</mark>

Focus on smallest unit of design:
- A procedure, 
- a class,
- a component

Test the following:
- Local data structures
- Basic algorithm
- Boundary conditions
- Error handling

May need drivers and stubs
Good idea to plan unit tests ahead

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Integration Testing:</mark>

If all parts work, how come the whole doesn’t?

For software, the whole is more than the sum of the parts
- Individual imprecision is magnified
- Unclear interface design
	
Don’t try the “big bang” integration !

Do incremental integration
- Top-down integration
- Bottom-up integration

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Functional Testing: </mark>

(Not covered in notes, gotten from other students.)

Focuses on if components meet their brief or not.

Tests operations and methods across the system.
### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Unit vs. Integration Testing:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/F6Y98A5.png)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Top-Down Integration:</mark>

- Test the main control module first
- Slowly replace stubs with real code
	- Can go depth-first, along a favourite path, to create a working system quickly
	- Or, breadth first
- Problem: you may need complex stubs to test higher-levels

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Bottom-Up Integration:</mark>

- Integrate already tested modules
- No stubs, but need drivers. Often the drivers are easier to write
- Example:
	- Financial code that depends on subroutine for computing roots of polynomials
	- We cannot test the code without the subroutine. A simple stub might not be enough
	- We can develop and test the subroutine first.

- Plan for testability !

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Validation Testing:</mark>

- Culmination of integration testing and functional testing: The software works, but does it do what we need?
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Run acceptance tests:</mark> Get your customer to define them
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Alpha-testing</mark> (in controlled environment): With developer looking over the shoulder
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Beta-testing:</mark> At end-user sites

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Other forms of High-Level Testing:</mark>

- System testing: Involves non-software components
- Security testing: Red-team testing
- Performance testing: E.g., real-time systems
- Stress testing ...

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Stress Testing:</mark>

Push system into extreme situations and see if it still works . . .

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Stress:</mark>
- Performance: Feed data at very high, very low rates
- Interfaces: Replace APIs with badly behaved stubs
- Internal structures: Works for any size array? Try sizes 0 and 1.
- Resources: Set memory artificially low. Same for # of file descriptors, network connections, etc.

Stress testing will find many obscure bugs. Explores the corner cases of the design: “Bugs lurk in corners, and congregate at boundaries”

Some may not be worth fixing: Too unlikely in practice

A corner case now is tomorrow’s common case
- Data rates, data sizes always increasing
- Your software will be stressed

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Black Box Testing:</mark>

(Not covered in his notes.)

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Black Box Testing</mark> is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. 

Only the external design and structure are tested

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">White Box Testing:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">White Box Testing</mark> is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. 

Implementation and impact of the code are tested.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Assertions:</mark>

Use <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">assert(...)</mark> liberally
- Documents important invariants
- Makes your code self-checking
- And does it on every execution!

Opinion: Most programmers don’t use assert enough

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">A Problem:</mark>

Testing is weak: Can never test more than a tiny fraction of possibilities

Testers don’t know as much about the code as
the developers, but developers can only do so much testing

What can we do?

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Code Inspections:</mark>

Here’s an idea: Understand the code!

One person explains to a group of programmers how
a piece of code works

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Key points:</mark>
- Don’t try to read too much code at one sitting
- A few pages at most
- Everyone comes prepared
- Distribute code beforehand
- No blame
- Goal is to understand, clarify code, not roast programmers

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Experience with Inspections:</mark>

Inspections work!
- Finds 70%-90% of bugs in studies
- Dramatically reduces cost of finding bugs

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Other advantages:</mark>
- Teaches everyone the code
- Finds bugs earlier than testing

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Bottom line:</mark> More than pays for itself

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Manual Testing:</mark>

Test cases are lists of instructions - “test scripts”

Someone manually executes the script and does each action, step-by-step
- Click on “login”
- Enter username and password
- Click “OK”
- ...

And manually records results

Low-tech, simple to implement

Manual testing is very widespread
- Probably not dominant, but very, very common

Why? Because:
- Some tests can’t be automated (Usability testing)
- Some tests shouldn’t be automated (Not worth the cost)

Those are the <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">best reasons</mark>

There are also <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">not-so-good reasons</mark>:
- Not-so-good because innovation could remove them
- Testers aren’t skilled enough to handle automation
- Automation tools are too hard to use
- The cost of automating a test is 10x doing a manual test

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Automated Testing:</mark>

Idea:
- Record manual test
- Play back on demand

This doesn’t work as well as expected, E.g., Some tests can’t/shouldn’t be automated

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Fragility:</mark>

Test recording is usually very fragile:
- Breaks if environment changes anything
- E.g., location, background colour of textbox

More generally, automation tools cannot generalise:
- They literally record exactly what happened
- If anything changes, the test breaks

A hidden strength of manual testing:
- Because people are doing the tests, ability to adapt tests to slightly modified situations is built-in

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Breaking Tests:</mark>

When code evolves, tests break:
- E.g., change the name of a dialog box
- Any test that depends on the name of that box breaks

Maintaining tests is a lot of work
- Broken tests must be fixed; this is expensive
- Cost is proportional to the number of tests
- Implies that more tests is not necessarily better

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Improved Automated Testing:</mark>

Recorded tests are too low level:
- E.g., every test contains the name of the dialog box

Need to abstract tests:
- Replace dialog box string by variable name X
- Variable name X is maintained in one place So that when the dialog box name changes, only X needs to be updated and all the tests work again

This is just structured programming: Just as hard as any other system design

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Regression Testing:</mark>

Idea:
- When you find a bug,
- Write a test that exhibits the bug,
- And always run that test when the code changes,
- So that the bug doesn’t reappear 

Without regression testing, it is surprising how often old bugs reoccur

Regression testing ensures forward progress: We never go back to old bugs

Regression testing can be manual or automatic: Ideally, run regressions after every change to detect problems as quickly as possible

But, regression testing is expensive
- Limits how often it can be run in practice
- Reducing cost is a long-standing research problem

Other tests (besides bug tests) can be checked for regression
- Requirements/acceptance tests
- Performance tests

Ideally, entire suite of tests is rerun on a regular basis to assure old tests still work

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Nightly Build:</mark>

Build and test the system regularly: Every night

Why? Because it is easier to fix problems earlier
- Easier to find the cause after one change than after 1,000
- Avoids new code from building on the buggy code

Test is usually subset of full regression test
- “smoke test”
- Just make sure there is nothing horribly wrong

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Discussion:</mark>

Testers have two jobs:
- Clarify the specification
- Find (important) bugs

Only the latter is subject to automation

Helps explain why there is so much manual testing

Nevertheless, automate as much as you can

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Back to Design:</mark>

Testing has a profound impact on design because some designs are easier to test.

Design software so it can be tested!

Or at least avoid designing software that cannot be tested

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Principles of Testability:</mark>

Avoid unpredictable results

No unnecessary non-deterministic behaviour

Design in self-checking

At appropriate places have system check its own work (Asserts)

May require adding some redundancy to the code

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Principles of Testabilty:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Avoid system state:</mark>
- System retains nothing across units of work: A transaction, a session, etc.
- System returns to well-known state after each task is complete: Easiest system to test

Minimize interactions between features:
- Number of interactions can easily grow huge
- Rich breeding ground for bugs

Have a test interface

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Testing Frameworks:</mark>

Key components of a test system are
- Building the system to test (May build many different versions to test)

Running the tests

Deciding whether tests passed/failed )Sometimes a non-trivial task, e.g., compilers)

Reporting results

Testing frameworks provide these functions – E.g. JUnit

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Summary:</mark>

Testing requires a certain mindset

Want to break the code

Good testing is hard work:
- Requires real insight into the nature of the system
- Will help elucidate the spec
