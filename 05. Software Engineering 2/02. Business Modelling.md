### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Describing Use Cases:</mark>

A use case comprises all the possible interactions that a user can have when performing a given task

These are described as <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">courses of events</mark>, or <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">scenarios</mark>

A full description of a use case includes:
- a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">basic</mark> course of events
- an number of alternative and exceptional courses

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Basic Course of Events:</mark>

This describes what happens in the ‘normal’ case

For example, for ‘Record Booking’:
1. receptionist enters date
2. system displays bookings
3. receptionist enters details
4. system records and displays new booking

Often a dialogue between system and user

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Alternative course of events:</mark>

- Describe predicted alternative flows
- For example, if no table is available:
	1. receptionist enters date
	2. system displays bookings
	3. no table available: end of use case
	
    
### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Exceptional Courses of Events:</mark>

Situations where a mistake has been made

E.g. allocate a booking to a small table
1.  receptionist enters date
2.  system displays bookings
3. receptionist enters details
4. system asks for confirmation of oversize booking
5. if “no”, use case terminates with no booking made
6. if “yes”, booking recorded with warning flag
	

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Use case templates:</mark>

UML does not define a standard format for use case descriptions

Various <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">templates</mark> have been defined to structure descriptions

Essentially a list of subheadings such as:
- name
- actors
- courses of events
	
    
### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">User-interface Prototype:</mark>

When writing use cases, it is useful to have a rough idea of the planned user interface

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Shared Functionality:</mark>

Different use cases can overlap

E.g. ‘Record Arrival’:
- head waiter enters date
- system displays bookings
- head waiter confirms arrival for booking
- system records this and updates display

First two steps shared with ‘Record Booking’ (even though different actor)

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Use Case Inclusion:</mark>

Move shared functionality to a separate use case, eg ‘Display Bookings’:
1. user enters a date
2. system displays bookings for that date

Include this in other use cases:
1. receptionist performs ‘Display Bookings’
2. receptionist enters details
3. system records and displays new booking    

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">The 'include' Dependency:</mark>

UML shows inclusion as a dependency between use cases, labelled with the stereotype include:

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Actor Generalisation:</mark>

This diagram shows that the receptionist can display bookings without performing the including use case ‘Record Booking’

Head waiters can also display bookings

Introduce a more general actor to show what the other two actors have in common

The initial actors are <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">specialisations</mark> of the general actor

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Use Case Extension:</mark>

Recording a walk-in can be described as an exceptional source of events: someone arrives but there’s no booking recorded

It could also be a separate use case: A customer arrives and asks if there's a free table

Then it can extend ‘Record Arrival’. Even without a booking, the customer stays to eat

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">The 'extend' Dependency:</mark>

Use case extension is shown with a dependency

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Domain Modelling:</mark>
    
Using UML to construct a model of the real-world system - similar to entity-relationship modelling
        
Model recorded as a class diagram

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">‘Seamless development’: </mark> 
- same notation used for analysis and design
- design can evolve from initial domain model

  
### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Domain Model Notation:</mark>

Subset of class diagram notation
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">classes</mark> represent real-world entities
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">associations</mark> represent relationships between the entities
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">attributes</mark> represent the data held about entities
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">generalisation</mark> can be used to simplify the structure of the model
	

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Customers and Reservations:</mark>

Basic business fact: customers make reservations

![](https://i.imgur.com/c1veJJB.png)

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Defining a Relationships:</mark>

Give a name to the relationship
- use a verb so that the relationship can be read as a sentence
	
A customer can make many reservations

How many people make a reservation?
- one principal contact whose details are held
- the expected number of diners can be modelled as an attribute of the reservation


### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Tables:</mark>

Is table number an attribute of ‘Reservation’?

Better modelled as a separate class
- tables exist even if there are no reservations
- other attributes of tables, e.g. size, can be stored

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Constraints:</mark>

Not all domain properties can be shown graphically e.g. it should be impossible to double-book a table

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Constraints</mark> add information to models: Written in a note connected to the model element being constrained
    
### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Use of Generalisation:</mark>

A superclass can be used to show the properties shared by different types of booking

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Correctness:</mark>

How do we know when a domain model is complete? We don't: there are lots of plausible models in most cases

Domain modelling is not an end in itself, but a guide to further development

Realizing use cases tests the domain model, and will usually lead to refinements

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Glossaries:</mark>

- Domain models capture important system concepts
- Useful to record these terms and their definitions for use throughout a project
- Do this in the form of a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">glossary</mark>

### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Partial restaurant glossary:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Booking:</mark> an assignment of diners to a table
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Covers:</mark> the number of diners for a booking
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Customer:</mark> a person who makes a reservation
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Reservation:</mark> a booking made in advance
- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Walk-in:</mark> a booking that is not made in advance
