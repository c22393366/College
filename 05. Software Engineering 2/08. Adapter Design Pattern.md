Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Also
known as Wrapper

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Motivation:</mark>

Sometimes a toolkit class that's designed for reuse isn't reusable only because its interface doesn't match the domain-specific interface an application requires.

Consider for example a drawing editor that lets users draw and arrange graphical elements (lines, polygons, text, etc.) into pictures and diagrams. The drawing editor's key abstraction is the graphical object, which has an editable shape and can draw itself. The interface for graphical objects is defined by an abstract class called Shape.

The editor defines a subclass of Shape for each kind of graphical object: a ``LineShape`` class for lines, a ``PolygonShape`` class for polygons, and so forth.

Classes for elementary geometric shapes like ``LineShape`` and ``PolygonShape`` are rather easy to implement, because their drawing and editing capabilities are inherently limited. But a ````TextShape```` subclass that can display and edit text is considerably more difficult to implement, since even basic text editing involves complicated screen update and buffer management. Meanwhile, an off-the-shelf user interface toolkit might already provide a sophisticated ````TextView```` class for displaying and editing text. Ideally we'd like to reuse ````TextView```` to implement ````TextShape````, but the toolkit wasn't designed with Shape classes in mind. So we can't use ````TextView```` and Shape objects interchangeably.

How can existing and unrelated classes like ````TextView```` work in an application that expects classes with a different and incompatible interface? We could change the ````TextView```` class so that it conforms to the Shape interface, but that isn't an option unless we have the toolkit's source code. Even if we did, it wouldn't make sense to change ````TextView````; the toolkit shouldn't have to adopt domain-specific interfaces just to make one application work.

Instead, we could define ````TextShape```` so that it adapts the ````TextView```` interface to Shape's. We can do this in one of two ways:
1) by inheriting Shape's interface and ````TextView````'s implementation or
2) by composing a ````TextView```` instance within a ````TextShape```` and implementing ````TextShape```` in terms of ````TextView````'s interface. These two approaches correspond to the class and object versions of the Adapter pattern. 

We call ````TextShape```` an adapter.

This diagram illustrates the object adapter case. It shows how BoundingBox requests, declared in class Shape, are converted to GetExtent requests defined in ``TextView``.

Since ``TextShape`` adapts ``TextView`` to the Shape interface, the drawing editor can reuse the otherwise incompatible ``TextView`` class.

Often the adapter is responsible for functionality the adapted class doesn't provide. The diagram shows how an adapter can fulfill such responsibilities. The user should be able to "drag" every Shape object to a new location interactively, but ``TextView`` isn't designed to do that. ``TextShape`` can add this missing functionality by implementing Shape's CreateManipulator operation, which returns an instance of the appropriate Manipulator subclass.

Manipulator is an abstract class for objects that know how to animate a Shape in response to user input, like dragging the shape to a new location. There are subclasses of Manipulator for different shapes; TextManipulator, for example, is the corresponding subclass for ``TextShape``. By returning a TextManipulator instance, ``TextShape`` adds the functionality that ``TextView`` lacks but Shape requires.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Applicability:</mark>

Use the Adapter pattern when
- you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.
- (object adapter only) you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Structure:</mark>

A class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another:

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Participants:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Target</mark> (``Shape``) - defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Client</mark> (``DrawingEditor``) - collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Adaptee</mark> (``TextView``) - defines an existing interface that needs adapting.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Adapter</mark> (``TextShape``) - adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Collaborations</mark> - Clients call operations on an Adapter instance. In turn, the adapter calls Adaptee operations that carry out the request.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Consequences:</mark>

Class and object adapters have different trade-offs. 

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">A class adapter:</mark>
- adapts Adaptee to Target by committing to a concrete Adapter class. As a consequence, a class adapter won't work when we want to adapt a class and all its subclasses.
- lets Adapter override some of Adaptee's behaviour, since Adapter is a subclass of Adaptee.
- introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the Adaptee.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">An object adapter:</mark>
- lets a single Adapter work with many Adaptees—that is, the Adaptee itself and all of its subclasses (if any). The Adapter can also add functionality to all Adaptees at once.
- makes it harder to override Adaptee behaviour. It will require subclassing Adaptee and making Adapter refer to the subclass rather than the Adaptee itself.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Issues to consider when using the Adapter pattern:</mark>

1. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">How much adapting does Adapter do?</mark> Adapters vary in the amount of work they do to adapt Adaptee to the Target interface. There is a spectrum of possible work, from simple interface conversion — for example, changing the names of operations—to supporting an entirely different set of operations. The amount of work Adapter does depends on how similar the Target interface is to Adaptee's.
2. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Pluggable adapters</mark>. A class is more reusable when you minimize the assumptions other classes must make to use it. By building interface adaptation into a class, you eliminate the assumption that other classes see the same interface. Put another way, interface adaptation lets us incorporate our class into existing systems that might expect different interfaces to the class. ObjectWorks\Smalltalk [Par90] uses the term pluggable adapter to describe classes with built-in interface adaptation.
 
Consider a ``TreeDisplay`` widget that can display tree structures graphically. If this were a special-purpose widget for use in just one application, then we might require the objects that it displays to have a specific interface; that is, all must descend from a Tree abstract class. But if we wanted to make ``TreeDisplay`` more reusable (say we wanted to make it part of a toolkit of useful widgets), then that requirement would be unreasonable. Applications will define their own classes for tree structures. They shouldn't be forced to use our Tree abstract class. Different tree structures will have different interfaces.

 In a directory hierarchy, for example, children might be accessed with a ``GetSubdirectories`` operation, whereas in an inheritance hierarchy, the corresponding operation might be called ``GetSubclasses``. A reusable ``TreeDisplay`` widget must be able to display both kinds of hierarchies even if they use different interfaces. In other words, the ``TreeDisplay`` should have interface adaptation built into it.
