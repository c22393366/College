# <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Design by Contract - beyond Class Modelling</mark>


### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Introduction</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Design by Contract (DbC</mark>) or Programming by Contract is an approach to designing software.

It says that designers should define precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, with the use of preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as "contracts"; in the same way as a business contract entails certain obligations and conditions.

Developed by Bertrand Meyer, “Bubbles (aka UML boxes) don’t crash”, and forms a central feature of Eiffel

Uses <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">assertions</mark> – assertion is a Boolean statement that should never be false. If so, it indicates a bug

Assertions usually only checked during debugging/testing

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Three kinds of assertions:</mark>
- post-conditions
- pre-conditions
- invariants
	
Pre-conditions and post- conditions are associated with operations

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Pre-condition:</mark>

Expresses something about the state of a program that should be true before an operation is executed

e.g. a pre-condition for an integer-square-root operation might be  ``input >= 0``, which indicates it is an error to invoke square-root on a negative number

e.g. ``pop()`` should net be called on an empty stack, precondition is ``s.isEmpty() == false``

Makes explicit that the calling routine is responsible for ensuring that something is true before operation is invoked

Lack of one may lead to too little or too much checking (duplicate checking code and thus more complicated program)

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Post Condition:</mark>

A statement of what things should be like after the execution of an operation e.g. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">integer-square-root</mark> operation

``result * result <= input < (result+1)*(result+1)``

Expresses <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">what</mark> an operation does rather than <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">how</mark> it does it

Separates implementation from interface

Leads to a stronger definition of an <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">exception</mark>. Exception occurs when an operation is invoked with its pre-condition satisfied and is unable to return with its post-condition true

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">DbC Exceptions:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Exceptions:</mark> Exceptions might be appropriate in certain cases, such as:
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Violation of Preconditions:</mark> If a client fails to meet the preconditions, the provider code might throw an exception to signal the violation.
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Invariant Violations:</mark> If the provider code detects that its internal state violates its invariants, it might throw an exception to indicate a programming error.
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Unexpected Postcondition Failures:</mark> If the provider code cannot fulfil its postconditions due to unexpected circumstances, it might throw an exception to indicate a failure.
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Error Handling:</mark> In cases where exceptional conditions occur during the execution of the provider code, it might throw exceptions for error handling purposes.
### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Spec# Example:</mark>

http://www.rise4fun.com/SpecSharp

The following shows a C# implementation of integer square-root() where the precondition (requires) and postcondition (ensures) are described in Spec#. Spec# supports DbC for C#. They form a contract for the method. It can be proved that the method code satisfies the contract.

```C#
class Fig1 
{
	int ISqrt(int x)
		requires 0 <= x;
		ensures result*result <= x && x < (result+1)*(result+1);
	{
		int r = 0;
		while ((r+1)*(r+1) <= x)
			invariant r*r <= x;
		{
			r++;
		}
		
		return r;
	}
}
```

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Invariant:</mark>

An assertion about a class or a method

Invariant is always true for class instances – meaning whenever object is available for an operation to be invoked on it

May be temporarily false during execution of method

e.g. Account class ``balance == sum of transaction amounts``

e.g. in the above Spec# example, ``r*r <= x`` is an invariant of the while loop

Invariant is added to pre-conditions and post-conditions of public methods

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Subclassing/Polymorphism:</mark>

Assertions useful with polymorphism, assertions can help keep subclass operations consistent with those of superclass invariants and post-conditions must be true for all subclasses, subclass can strengthen these, i.e. make them more restrictive

Not allowed to strengthen pre-conditions – because of substitutability, can only weaken a pre-condition,

If a subclass strengthened a pre-condition, then a superclass operation could fail when applied to instance of subclass

Pre-conditions: best pay-off for least overhead

One language to support assertions is Eiffel

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">DbC and OCL:</mark>

The following material is largely drawn from the text: Model Driven Architecture – Applying MDA to Enterprise Computing by David S. Frankel.

The following class diagram is to be used with the DbC constraints described in OCL on the following page. Note that DbC does not have to use OCL (object constraint language). OCL is now officially part of UML 2.0.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">DbC constraints have two basic purposes:</mark>
- highlighting unacceptable corner case
- expressing key semantics of class or operation to which they apply

E.g. ``ReceivableAccount`` invariant indicates that an invoice cannot be both processed and
unprocessed.

Post-condition for ``EndOfMonthUpdate()`` says in platform-independent fashion that current balances need to be rolled over to 30 day balances. Reflects a business rule.

Similarly, ``EndOfMonthUpdate()`` pre-condition that there should be no unprocessed invoices
reflects another business rule.

Constraints nail down properties of classes without predetermining platform specific techniques for implementing them.

Contracts are useful to clients and generators. OCL constraints flesh out the model and connect the dots for generators and programmers and help discover design flaws.

The more precisely a classes properties are specified, the easier it is to reuse the class. OO and component based development promise reuse as major advantage. But developers find class or component reuse difficult without access to source code because the usage contract is not well specified.

Interoperability between components from different companies also an issue even when components support standardised interfaces, messages and protocols unless there is a good understanding of the contract that the interface must honour when implemented. 

Important to Java Community process, OMG, and B2Bi initiatives.

Interoperability is based on shared understanding among interoperating objects.
- Syntactic interoperability – e.g. CORBA’s IDL & IIOP allow shared understanding of operation signature. Allows values to pass thru all transport layers transparently.
- Semantic interoperability based on objects’ ability to coordinate their functioning based on a shared understanding of the semantics.
- Formal DbC contracts improve semantic interoperability. Hence have an important contribution to make to B2Bi.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Precision versus Detail:</mark>


DbC constraint writing in OCL is a form of coding. It is more abstract than 3GL programming as it omits many implementation details that are necessary in a 3GL. But it is still no less precise than 3GL.

Example of an electric motor to illustrate precision versus detail. Spec can very precise while giving no detail as to internals of motor. Abstraction is suppression of irrelevant detail, not vagueness.

Can infer exceptions for operations from DbC constraints. Pre-condition maps directly to an exception to be thrown when the operation is invoked and the precondition is not satisfied.

A lot of tool support now available for checking constraints at runtime, e.g. with Spec#. Generate code for checking constraints. Can specify when in time they are to be checked.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">DbC and QA:</mark>

DbC can provide a framework for quality assurance (QA). Pre-conditions, post-conditions and
invariants represent much of what QA engineer must validate. DbC constraints can be used by code generators to produce test harnesses or for program verification as in Boogie tool with Spec#.

Even when not used automatically, DbC constraints act as precise guides to QA engineers regarding what they must test. Also useful for code reviews or walk throughs.

There are other non-functional factors such as scalability and performance, that are not covered by DbC assertions. Can use other UML extension for these.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Tool Support:</mark>

Many tools have slots for associating constraints with classes and operations.

MDA tools may include OCL editing facilities for writing OCL assertions, similar to IDEs for 3GLs.

Main barrier to effective use of DbC is software development pressure. Rigorous DbC can be time consuming. However, MDA DbC may be timesaving as generators elaborate each formal constraint into many lines of application and test harness code.

Without MDA, DbC only addresses quality. With MDA, it can help with production costs.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Comment:</mark>

UML class diagrams act as constraints on instances of those classes. OCL describes other constraints that class diagram cannot show.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Behavioural Modelling:</mark>

Class models with DbC do not describe control flow and state changes inside code. Do not detail how objects interact. They are static structure models rather than behavioural models such as use cases, state machines, activity diagrams and sequence diagrams.

However a DbC based class does describe behaviour when it specifies pre and post-conditions for the class operations. But it strictly confines itself to aspects of behaviour relevant to a client. See example below.

Behavioural modelling is at least as important to MDA as static modelling. Some of the most advanced industrial MDA is based on behavioural modelling. E.g. Shlaer-Mellor systems use state machines to generate embedded code for things like photocopiers and telecom switches.

State machines fall into two categories. One deals with transitions of public class attributes, i.e. attributes visible to clients and thus part of the contract (protocol state machines).

For a DbC class, all the info in such a state machines would also be available in the class model (see following example). Protocol state machine is another representation of info available that a correct DbC-based class model provides. Note, DbC constraints can convey more and be more complex than a state machine.
