### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Summary:</mark>

Software architecture and design generate a lot of conversational heat but not much light. 

To start a new conversation about alternative ways to think about them, this article launches the [Evolutionary architecture and emergent design](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=evolutionary+architecture+emergent+design:) series. 

Evolutionary architecture and emergent design are agile techniques for deferring important decisions until the last responsible moment.

In this introductory instalment, series author Neal Ford defines architecture and design and then identifies overarching concerns that will arise throughout the series.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Defining Architecture:</mark>

Still have only vague definitions for it

When we discuss architecture, we're really talking about several different but related concerns that generally fall into the broad categories of <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">application architecture</mark> and <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">enterprise architecture</mark>

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Application Architecture:</mark>

Application architecture describes the coarse-grained pieces that compose an application
 
In the Java world, for example, application architecture describes two things:     
- the combination of frameworks used to build a particular application, which may be called the <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">framework-level architecture</mark>
- the more traditional logical separation of concerns

Object-oriented practitioners have discovered that individual classes don't work well as a reuse mechanism, hence separate out framework architecture

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Application Architecture & Frameworks:</mark>

The unit of reuse in modern object-oriented languages is the library or framework    

When you start a new project in framework-rich languages like the Java language, one of the first architectural concerns is the application's framework-level architecture

Could say Java has become a framework-oriented language    

Framework-level architecture represents a physical architecture, described by specific building blocks

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Application Architecture:</mark>

How do the logical pieces of the application fit together?

This is the realm of design patterns and other structural descriptions, and thus tends to be both more abstract and logical rather than physical    

For example, you can say that a Web application adheres to the Model-View-Presenter pattern without specifying which framework you use to achieve that logical arrangement

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Enterprise Architecture:</mark>

Concerned itself with how the enterprise as a whole uses applications 

Application architecture likens enterprise to city planning and application to building architecture

Enterprise architecture has gotten a lot of attention because of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

SOA blurs the lines between enterprise and application architecture when it dictates characteristics of application construction

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Extant Definitions:</mark>

Superficial so far, need to be more nuanced

Fowler reports “The RUP, working off the IEEE definition, defines architecture as 'the highest level concept of a system in its environment. The architecture of a software system (at a given point in time) is its organization or structure of significant components interacting through interfaces, those components being composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.’”

Fits within the realm of application architecture described above. While vague, it does capture the essence of architecture's responsibility: the highest-level concept.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Extant Definitions:</mark>

Johnson says "A better definition would be: 'In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the design system design. This shared understanding is called "architecture." This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces.'“

Software development relies on communication more than technology

Architecture really represents the shared knowledge about the system, not technological ephemera

Fowler himself provides a good succinct definition of architecture: "Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is." 

What's important to business analysts differs from the important stuff for an enterprise architect

Or yet another: "Stuff that's hard to change later."  fits best into the idea of an evolutionary architecture

A core idea behind evolutionary architecture is to defer decisions as late as you can, which allows you to substitute alternatives that recent experience has shown are superior

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Defining Design:</mark>

Represents the nuts and bolts of how a piece of software goes together

Encompasses well-trodden territory such as design patterns, refactoring, frameworks, and other daily developer concerns

Design roughly falls on a spectrum between <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">BDUF</mark> (Big Design Up Front) and Cowboy Hacking

BDUF suggests that you can anticipate all the hundreds and thousands of concerns that pop up when you develop software and tries to limit your responses to them

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Architectural and Design Concerns:</mark>

Why the distinction between <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">evolutionary</mark> and <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">emergent</mark>? 

Emergent architecture not a good idea. If you accept that architecture is about things hard to change later, it becomes difficult to allow an architecture to emerge.

Architecture concerns infrastructure elements that must exist before you can start the application. However, just because you can't allow architecture to emerge doesn't mean that it can't <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">evolve</mark>. 

If you have created a flexible architecture and taken care not to create an irreversible decision, you can allow it to evolve over time as new concerns appear.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Principal and Interest - Technical Debt:</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Technical debt:</mark> make compromises in design for the sake of some external force, such as schedule pressure

Hack a just-in-time solution and hope to use some future time to come back and retrofit it

Compromises made now for the sake of expediency cause <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">entropy</mark> (measure of complexity) to build up in your software and a price will have to be paid for that for the remaining life of the project
 
Can think of inherent complexity as the principal, and the extra effort imposed by previous expedient shortcuts as the interest

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Technical Debt and Interest:</mark>

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Essential versus Accidental Complexity:</mark>

Problems solved in software have an inherent complexity, which may be called <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">essential</mark> complexity
 
<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Accidental</mark> complexity arises from the compromises made that incur technical debt. Externally imposed ways that software becomes complex

Payroll example with extra day off in one factory only adds essential complexity as it is part of business rules  

Accidental complexity:
- Just in time hacking
- Pure plumbing exercises like the first two versions of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB. A few projects need the extra overhead introduced by these tools, but they do nothing but add complexity to most of the projects that use them.

Three things tend to spawn accidental complexity
- just-in-time hacks
- Duplication is the single most insidious diminishing force in software development
	- Can arise from copy-and-paste
	- Object-relational mapping tool tend to have lots of duplication. Database schema, the XML mapping file, and the backing POJOs have slightly different but overlapping information. 
    
- The third enabler of accidental complexity is <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">irreversibility</mark>. Any decision made that cannot be reversed will eventually lead to some level of accidental complexity.

- Irreversibility affects both architecture and design, although its effects are both more common and more damaging at the architectural level.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Principle of Last Responsible Moment:</mark>

What can I do to allow me to defer that decision?

E.g. distinction made earlier between framework-level architecture and application architecture

Suppose you know that you want the separation of concerns of Model-View-Presenter   

Too often the leap to a physical implementation of that logical architecture by choosing a framework that meets some or all of the requirements

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Rampant Genericness:</mark>

Overengineering solutions by trying to make them as generic as possible – common in Java world

Build in lots of layers for extension, and later more functionality can be more easily built  

Dangerous trap as genericness adds entropy or complexity

Damage your ability to evolve the design in interesting ways early in the project

Adding too much flexibility makes every change to the code base more complex

Planning for the project to live as long as possible truncated its life

YAGNI  is an Agile Approach - just implement exactly what you need now, and if you need more stuff later, you can add it then

How to navigate the fine line between extensibility and overengineering is difficult


### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Anticipatory Design versus Refactoring, comparing pre-internet and today:</mark>

Anticipatory design and refactoring are two approaches in the realm of software development, each addressing different stages of a product's lifecycle. Let's explore how these approaches compare in the context of both pre-internet and today's digital landscape.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Pre-Internet Era:</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Anticipatory Design:</mark> In the pre-internet era, anticipatory design was primarily focused on predicting user needs based on historical data or expert knowledge. Designers would anticipate what users might want or need and integrate those features or functionalities into the product. However, the data available for anticipation was limited compared to today's vast amounts of user data.

- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Refactoring:</mark> Refactoring in the pre-internet era was more about improving the structure and efficiency of code rather than responding to user feedback or market trends. It involved revisiting and restructuring existing code to make it more maintainable, scalable, and efficient. However, the feedback loop from users was slower and less direct, so refactoring might have been less influenced by user needs compared to today.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Today's Digital Landscape:</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Anticipatory Design:</mark> Today, anticipatory design leverages big data, machine learning, and predictive analytics to anticipate user needs in real-time. With the abundance of user data generated through interactions with digital products and services, designers can create personalized and contextually relevant experiences. Anticipatory design now extends beyond just predicting user actions; it includes proactive suggestions and automation based on user behaviour patterns.

- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Refactoring:</mark> In today's digital landscape, refactoring remains crucial but is more closely tied to agile development practices and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. With rapid release cycles and direct user feedback channels such as user analytics, A/B testing, and user feedback tools, refactoring is often driven by user needs, market changes, or technological advancements. It's not just about improving code quality but also about optimizing user experience and staying competitive in a fast-paced digital market.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Comparison:</mark>

- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Anticipatory Design vs. Refactoring:</mark> While anticipatory design focuses on predicting and meeting user needs before they arise, refactoring is about iteratively improving the product based on real-time feedback and evolving requirements. Anticipatory design aims to reduce user effort and enhance user satisfaction by providing seamless and intuitive experiences, whereas refactoring aims to maintain code quality, enhance product scalability, and adapt to changing user demands.

- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Integration:</mark> Ideally, anticipatory design and refactoring should complement each other. Anticipatory design can inform the direction of refactoring efforts by identifying patterns in user behaviour and anticipating future needs, while refactoring ensures that the underlying codebase remains adaptable and maintainable to support the implementation of anticipatory features.


In summary, while anticipatory design and refactoring have evolved with advancements in technology and changes in user expectations, both remain essential in creating successful digital products that meet user needs and stay competitive in today's fast-paced digital landscape.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Exam Answer Summary:</mark>

Today, refactoring has become more popular than anticipatory design because of technological evolution and direct user feedback. User expectations and market trends are constantly evolving. Agile practices prioritise iterative development and continuous improvement, embedding refactoring into the development process. Direct user feedback channels enable developers to identify and prioritise areas for enhancement, ensuring code remains maintainable, scalable, and responsive to user needs. Consequently, refactoring has become indispensable in modern software development.
