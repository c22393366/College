Human Computer Interaction - Users and Interfaces
-----------------------------------------------------

Human computer interaction is "concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of
interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding
them".

Human Computer Interface is the study of the interaction between people and coomputers, and
involves the development and application of principles, guidelines, and methods to
support the design and evaluation of interactive systems.

There are many disciplines concerned with HCI, featured on slides 6 to 9.

To the user, information is input and output as:
	> Visual.
	> Auditory.
	> Haptic.
	> Movement.

To the user, information is stored in memory:
	> Sensory Memory - visual, tactile, auditory, etc.
	> Short-Term Memory.
	> Long-Term Memory.

To the user, information is processed and applied with:
	> Reasoning.
	> Problem-Solving.
	> Skill.
	> Error.

Emotion influences human capabilities.

As HCI designers, engineers, and programmers, we must remeber each person is different.

Other considerations for the user include:
	> Motivation.
	> Enjoyment.
	> Satisfaction.
	> Experience Level.

Computers are used in social organisation and work, where humans interact as social beings.

It is important to consider models of human activity.

It is also important to consider the domains of work being done, for example individual
versus group work.

These may have popular styles in:
	> Document Production.
	> Communications.
	> Design.
	> Tutorials.
	> Control Systems.

To improve the fit between a designed object and its use, we must adapt:
	> How systems are selected and adopted.
	> How users improvise routine systems.
	> How systems adapt to the user.
	> How users adapt to the system.
	> User guidance.

The interaction in "human computer interaction" is a process.

To understand it, we need to understand computers, and the processes associated with them.

Years ago, computers performed batch processing.

Punched card stacks or large data files were prepared.

This way of use led to long waits, and to mistakes being critical, and you needed to start
again and wait from the start.

These days, computing is rapid.

Feedback comes quickly, and the user is in control most of the time.

An interactive system may aim to update or replace an established system or develop
a totally innovative product.

Regardless of the initial situation, the following must be discussed, refined, clarified,
and probably rescoped:
	> The aim of the project.
	> The user's needs.
	> Requirements.
	> The user's aspirations and expections.

Design for interactivity requires an understanding of:
	> The users.
	> Their current tasks.
	> Their goals.
	> The conditions under which the product will be used.

To specify and design a usable system interfact, a software designer must develop an
understanding of the user, what they want, and what they will do as a result of the system.

This is a complex problem with many questions.

In order to achieve good UI design, participation in the process of understanding users and
evolving requirements is essential.

In order to design an effective UI, basic questions should be answered:
	> Who is the user?
	> Where is the interaction to take place?
	> What is the task?
	> What is the environment in which the system will operate?

There are many approaches to understanding users using a range of user research methods.
	> Observation.
	> Interview.
	> Questionnaire.
	> Focus Groups.
