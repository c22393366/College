Legal and Professional - Theme 4 - Intellectual Property Revision
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IP rights have evolved since 15th century legislation.

Different types of intellectual property protection can be either registered or unregistered.

Registered:
	> Patents
	> Trade Marks
	> Registered Designs
	> Domain Names

Unregistered:
	> Copyright
	> Unregistered Trade Marks
	> Unregistered Design Rights
	> Confidential Information

IP law is implemented on a 2 tier system.

A national patent office is responsible for accepting, processing, and granting patents, trademarks, and registered
design rights.

National courts are responsible for providing a forum in which IPR infringements can be enforced, and IPR validity
to be contested.



Confidential Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No registration required.

Must be protected by an agreement to keep the information confidential.

Covers anything that has a necessary quality of confidence about it.

Must not be in the public domain.

For duty of confidence, the info must be communicated, and the confidant must reasonably know it to be in confidence.

For a breach of confidence, there must be a risk of damage from the information being used or disclosed.

This is generally used to protect technical and commercial info which would be unpatentable.

Companies should ensure adequate steps to keep details secret, and that everyone in the organisation knows this.

A non-disclosure agreement should be used when disclosing important know-how, and should be signed by the party
prior to the disclosure.

A breach of confidentiality is typically a breach of contract and is treated as such in courts.



Patents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A patent is a monopoly right in an invention.

It covers how something works, what it does, how it is made, and what it is made from.

In certain situations, it can even apply to software based inventions.

They were first established in the 15th century, and granted to specific manufacturers and traders.

The monopoly right granted by a patent can be used to restrict others from making or selling an invention.

Patents only apply to the relevant country in which they are obtained.

Legal proceedings for an infrigement only apply after a patent has been granted.

It is possible to back date a claim for damages to the date of publication of the patent application.

A patent requires novelty, an inventive step, and industrial applicability.
	> Novelty - Absolute Requirement. Invention must not have been published or made available publicly
		    anywhere in the world before the patent was filed.

	> Inventive Step - Must not be obvious to a skilled person having regard to the state of the art. In other
			   words, not obvious to someone skilled in that area in light of all relevant knowledge
			   publicly know before the patent was filed. The skilled person is assumed to have read
			   all relevant materials, but not to be imaginitive or inventive.
			 - An invention is obvious only if it follows logically from what has come before it.

	> Indistrial Applicability - Generally used to exclude impossible inventions, such as perpetual motion.

Patent law excludes several things, such as: scientific or mathematical discoveries, aesthetic/artistic creations,
methods or rules for playing a game or doing business, a program for a computer, plants, animals, or biological
processes, methods of treatment for human and animnal bodies surgically or therapeutically, or inventions where
the industrial explotation of the invention would be contrary to common good, such as a pipe bomb.

Computer programs and inventions may be patentable, but often fall into the "methods or rules for playing a game or
doing business" area of exclusion, and end up unpatentable.

A patent application must include:
	> A technical description, specification, which is clear and complete enough for the invention to be
	  reproduced by a person skilled in the relevant technology.
	> One or more claims, which define, in words, the matter for which protection is sought. These claims will
	  be later used to determine protective scope, and what is an infringement.

The patent office searches for existing patents which fall inside the scope of the claims mentioned above.

18 months after filing, the results of this search and the contents of the patent application are made public.

After this comes an examinations period, after which the patent may or may not be granted.

If granted, an annual renewal fee must be paid to keep the patent in force, subject to a maximum 20 years.

The Paris Convention is a document which was drawn up to make the absolute novelty requirements that countries
apply compatible with the possibility of filing for patent protection in multiple territories.

It provides priority rights to an applicant to allow them to file subsequent applications within 12 months of their
first for that invention and benefit from the filing date of the first.

Collective patent systems can be used for filing patent applications covering more than one country:	
	> European Patent Convention - Doesn't ultimately result in a collective patent, but breaks down into a bundle
				       of various national patents, as though filed seperately across countries.
	> Patent Cooperation Treaty - Provides provisional protection in over 100 countries, subject to national law.

Some jurisdictions offer a petty patent model, wherein there are lowers costs and shorter durations.

There are several differences to the way patents work in the USA.

Patents are called Utility Patents, and Registered Designs are called Design Patents.

Entitlement to a patent is on a first-to-invent rather than first-to-file basis.

A disclosure made within 12 months prior to filing is not counted against the patent.

Much less subject matter is excluded from patentability.



Copyright
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A copyright automatically protects original works.

This extends over a wide range of fields like books, plays, paintings, broadcasts, photos, etc.

It doesn't just protect an idea, it protects the expression of the idea.

Dates back to ancient Greece and Rome, and was even recognised by Brehon law.

Works protected include:
	> Original literary, musical, dramatic, and artistic works.
	> Published editions of works, sound recordings, films, and broadcasts.
	> Computer programs, their preparatory materials.
	> Operating manuals, instruction books, and publicity material.

Registration is not required, but a carefully signed and dated evidence of the original work is wise to keep.

Protection exists automatically once the work has been fixed in some manner.

Must be original, and may be marked with the "C" copyright symbol, although not necessary in Ireland.

Copyright can be sold, bought, or otherwise transferred or licensed.

There is no copyright in names, slogans, phrases or jingles, etc.

Protection prevents others from:
	> Copying the work, or issuing copies to the public.
	> Performing, showing, or playing the work publically.
	> Broadcasting or adapting the work.
	> Possessing, selling, exhibiting, or otherwise dealing with an infringing copy.

There are extra rights for software, which can prevent others from making permanent or temporary copies of the program,
including where this is required to run, store, load, or display the program.

Lawful acquirers will have the right to use a computer program for its intended purpose.

The copyright owner can prevent translation, adaptation, arrangement, or otherwise alteration of the program.

They can also prevent circulation of a device to unauthorisedly remove or circumvent technical protection devices.

Non-literal copying applies too.

Moral rights include the right to be identified as the author or directior of a work, the right to object to
derogatory treatment of the work, and the right not to have a work falsely attributed to them.

The duration of protection depends on the work, but is generally equal to the authors lifetime, plus 70 years.



Database Right
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A database may be protected by copyright, or by a database right, AKA Sui Generis.

A database is usually defined as a collection of data or other material that is arranged systematically such that
items are individually accessible.

Copyright protection covers any forms of database falling within this definition, not just computer-based ones.

For copyright protection, a database must have originality in the selection or arrangement of contents.

Sui Generis is a special additional right which protects databases.

The database must be the result of substantial investment.

No registration is required, and the duration is 15 years from the creation or publication.

An infringement is considered on extraction or reutilization of a substantial part of the database.



Trade Marks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Trade Marks protect the way in which goods and services are identified.

They are widely recognised as valuable company assets.

Trade Marks used to be a marking placed upon goods by their crafter.

Trade Marks can be registered or unregistered.

A disadvantage of unregistered ones is that it becomes far more difficult to prevent competitors from appropriating
the goodwill of the mark.

Must resort to common law and a legal action called "passing-off".

A third party cannot legally pass of its goods or services as being yours or being associated with you.

Trade Marks can be registered with a patent office.

The applicant will then have the exlusive right to use of the mark in that territory.

Registered Trade Marks use the circle "R" symbol, unregistered ones use the TM.

A Trade Mark is a word or logo or a combo of such used to distinguish one's goods and services from a competitor's.

A major part of a TM's value is the association with goodwill for a brand.

This helps customers identify a business and the quality of its products or services.

Brands are central to marketing programs. Many celebrities seek profit by merchandizing and using the rep of their name.

Registering their name as a TM is a way to achieve this.

A Trade Mark is first registered for 10 years, and can be indefinitely renewed on 10 year intervals.

Only so long as it is in constant, relevant use.

Almost anything, from words, shapes, logos, colors, smells, jingles, and more, can be a Trade Mark.

A TM cannot be misleading, nor should it be descriptive or the goods or services covered.

Surnames and geographical names can be tough to register.

Laudatory terms normally may not be registered, and a TM must act as a badge of origin for a product or service.

In addition to national TM registration systems, there are various collective systems through which TMs can be
registered.

The EU, for example, works a TM system.



Domain Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Domain names are not strictly an IP right.

They are simply an internet address leased from a domain register operator (.com, .org, .net).

Have acquired a further significane in business identification, and as such have come into conflict with systems
of business identification that have existed since before the internet, and are protected by IPRs.

Cybersquatting involves registering a domain name identical to, or only a letter or two off a popular site, and
waiting for people to come there looking for the real thing, to scam them or to pass of your product as authentic.

Many registries have specific dispute resolution policies.

Disputes can be resolved either by legal action or by dispute resolution procedure.

Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, or UDRP works for abusive registrations with a TM involved.

Remedy is limited, and includes cancellation or transfer of the domain registration, but no damages.

Domain names are typically leased on a yearly basis.



Design Rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Design Right is a monopoly right for the appearance or whole or part of a product.

Protection can also be obtained for the getup of a product - graphical symbols and typographical typefaces.

Laws protecting designs originated in the 18th century.

Registration gives monopoly protection over the appearance of a design.

For infringements, one must only show the two articles look the same.

This initially lasts 5 years, renewable every 5 years to a maximum of 25.

European Union operates a European registered design system.

Unregistered designs are a version of copyright that protects any original aspect of the shape or configuration
of the whole or part of an article.

Here, independent production of a similar design is not infringement.

Protection lasts 15 years from making, or 10 years from marketing, whichever expires earlier.
