Law
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rules and regulations set by the government to uphold order and prevent chaos.

A lot of laws, especially in western countries, come from root sources like the bible.

These include the ten commandments, etc.

ITC professionals have to be aware of laws for a number of reasons.

People in tech often have access to sensitive data, and must know what then can or cannot,
and should or should not do with it.

Also important is intellectual property. We need to know how to ensure our software products
do not violete IP laws.

It is also important to be able to protect one's own creations.

Contract law is particularly important. We will be employed under contract, companies will
want to secure contracts with clients, contracts are used to make agreements etc.

Tort law comes from an old French word meaning twist or tear, and refers to some breach
of an obligation.

Criminal law also applies, with things like hacking and other cybercrimes.

Modern Irish law finds its roots in English fedual law, on account of their colonialism.

These laws come from the Normans, who introduced them to the English.

Systems like this were not originally standardised, with individual towns or villages
having their own punishments and rulings for crimes.

Over time these became standardised, as common law or common rule.
