Data COmmunications - First IP Owner
--------------------------------------------

The first owner of an IP is usually its author or creator.

If employed and the creation is in the course of their employment, then the first owner
is the employer.

There is no assignment necessary to effect ownership by the employer in this situation.

If an employee's duties do not include anything that would be expected to result in the
creation of IP, the IP would belong to the employee.

In the case of directors, a greater duty to the company is expected, and the company will
likely get the IP.

The author of a computer generated work is generally considered to be the person by whom
the arrageements necessary for the work were undertaken.

Joint ownerships are also possible.

Licences and assignments are contracts which contain whatever provisions parties are willing
to include.

An assignment is typically an outright transfer of rights by the holder to another party.

Patent assignments involve writing, and requires signature of the assignor.

In certain countries there is typically a deadline of 6 months after execution to register
at the relative patent office.

A license usually involves a continuing relationship between the rights holder and the
organization wishing to exploit those rights.

The relationship may involve the continuing flow of information and technical assistance
from the licensor in return for financial compensation.

A license gives the holder the right to do something that would otherwise be an infringement.

Only the owner of the IPR can grant you a licnense.

There are solo and exclusive licenses. Solo grants use to the licensee and licensor, exclusive
grants rights only to licensee, and bars even the licensor from use.

Restrictions depend on the specific IP right.
