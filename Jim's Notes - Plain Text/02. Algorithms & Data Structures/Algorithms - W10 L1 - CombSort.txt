Algorithms - Who knows?
-------------------------------------------

There are two types of sorting algorithm:
	> Hard Split - Easy Join
	> Easy Split - Hard Join

The first type includes:
	> quickSort
	> selectionSort
	> heapSort

The second type includes:
	> mergeSort
	> insertionSort

CombSort is a vartiation on BubbleSort, designed to be an improvement.

It has a bit added on at the beginning to make it quicker.

In our example, the array is:
	> 9, 8, 5, 2, 7, 3, 4, 1, 0

We need to set a "gap shrink factor", for which we'll use 1.5.

We divide the our gap, which starts as the size of the array, by the shrink factor.

This time, with length 9, our gap is divided to length 6.

As long as gap is greater than one, the array isn't sorted.

If gap is one, we're finished.

While sorted is false, we iterate. We set the new gap value, and then test if finished yet.

We initialise a new value to i, and then enter an inner loop.

While i, plus gap, is less than the original input size, we iterate the inner loop.

If the array at position [i] is greater than at position [i + gap], we do the following:
	> Swap position[i] and position[i + gap]
	> Set sorted to false

Then after the if statement, we increment i.
