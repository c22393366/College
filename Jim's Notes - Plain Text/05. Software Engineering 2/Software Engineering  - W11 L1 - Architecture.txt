Software Engineering - Architecture
----------------------------------------------

Still only have vauge definitions for architecture.

There are broad categories of application and design architecture.

Application architecture describes the coarse-grained pieces that compose an application.

In the Java world, application architecture describes:
	> The combo of frameworks used to build a particular application.
	> The more traditional logical separation of concerns.

Object oriented practitioners have discovered that individual classes don't work well as a
reuse mechanism, hence we separate out framework architecture.

The unit of reuse in modern OOP is the library or framework.

When you start a new project in framework-rich languages like the Java language, one of the
first concerns is the framework-level architecture.

We can say that Java has become a framework oriented language.

Framework level architecture represents a physical architecture, described by specific building blocks.
