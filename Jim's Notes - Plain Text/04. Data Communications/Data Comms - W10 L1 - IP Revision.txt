Data Communication - IP Addressing - Revision
-----------------------------------------------------

IP addresses use 32 bits, divided into octets, with maximum values of 255 each.

This is called dotted decimal notation, and is used to be easier to read than a 32 bit value.

Classful addressing was how blocks of addresses were assigned to different people.

The prefix determined the class, meaning it determined the amount of addresses.
	> A - 0
	> B - 10
	> C - 110
	> D - 1110
	> E - 1111

The smallest quantity of addresses you could be given in one of these blocks was class C,
with 256 addresses.

This caused a large amount of wastage in terms of the number of possible IP addresses.

WIth classful addressing, the split between network prefix and host suffix was always on
an octet boundary.

Classless addressing did things differently, to save on addresses.

It uses a 32 bit value called an address mask or a subnet mask.

These facilitate the extraction of the network prefix from an IP address.

This is so that routing tables on routers can look only at the network portion of the address
and route packets to the network, which can handle the host portion itself.

THe mask is comprised of a contiguous sequence of 1 bits, followed by a contiguous block
of 0 bits.

They can be represented in dotted decimal like IP addresses.

They can also be shown CIDR, or Classless InterDomain Routing notation, which is a forward
slash followed by a number after the address.

For example, 192.4.10.0/24, or 255.255.255.0, tells us how many bits belong to the network
portion of the address.

The /24, and the 255.255.255 tell us that 24 bits belong to the network portion, with 8 left
for the hosts.

There are 256 possible addresses on this network, with examples like 192.4.10.20 and
192.4.10.30.

All addresses on this network will begin with 192.4.10.

However, we can't use the first or last ones, leaving us with a total of 254 to use.

For an incoming packet with a destination IP, D, the router tests the following condition:
	> A==(D&&M)

THe mask M is applied using the AND operation to the address. The AND operation effectively
zeroes out the last eight bits of the address, D.

The result is then compared to the A address.

Routers connect to multiple addresses, and when a packet is being passed to the destination
network, it must pass through connected routers until it reaches one connected to the
destination network.

Classless addressing makes more efficient use of the IP address space.

128.211.0.0 would traditionally be a class B address.

Using classful addressing, as a class B address, this network would have 65536 addresses.

This could only be given to one customer, meaning many of these addresses would go unused.

With classless addressing, this would be considered a /16 address mask.

Larger mask values can be used to split the address block into smaller blocks known as
subnets.

This means a customer can be given a space with only as many addresses as they need.

Given the address block 192.168.1.0/24, we can divide this into two subnets as follows:
	> /24 means 8 host bits, i.e. 256 addresses.
	> Of these, 254 are available for use.
	> We take one bit from the original host portion.
	> This extends the original mask by one bit, and we get 255.255.255.128.
	> The CIDR notation for this is now /25.
	> This is because there is now only 7 host bits, and 2^7 is 128.

As a result of this process, we now have two new subnets:
	> Address range 192.168.1.0-127
	> Address range 192.168.1.128-255
	> Both with address mask 255.255.255.128

With the magic number approach, an address tale for routing is easy to complete.

We want to divide 192.168.1.0/24 into 4 subnets.

To determine the number of bits to move, we figure out the power of two that gives 4.

This means we need to move 2 bits, which will be the 128 bit, and the 64 bit.

This means the new mask is 255.255.255.128 + 64, or 255.255.255.192.

Because we have moved 2 bits, this goes from a /24 to a /26 address, with 6 bits left
for host addresses.

The magic number here is 64, because 255 - 192 = 64.

With a magic number of 64, the first customer will get 192.168.1.0.

The second will get 192.168.1.64, the third will get 192.168.1.128, with 192.168.1.192
for the last one.

These are the starting addresses of each range given to each customer, their network address.

The first host address will be 1 on from the starting/network address.

Their broadcast address will be 1 less than the starting address of the next customer,
and their last host address will be one less than that again.
