Data COmmunications - Hardware Addressing
------------------------------------------------

LAN tech facilitates sharing of info between all locally connected devices.

Direct communication between specific pairs of stations is achieved using an addressing scheme.

Each station is assigned a unique MAC/Hardware Address (Medium Access Control Address).

An example of an ethernet MAC address is 00:40:05:1c:0e:9f.

Ethernet MAC addresses are 48-bit long and are usually represented in HEX format, 12 digits
each, each digit usually representing 4 bits.

The header with each transmitted frame contains the addresses of the sender and reciever.

THis allows the LAN interface card, or Network Inferface Card (NIC) to filter out frames
without conferring with the CPU.

The NIC only interrupts the CPU when it has specific data for the station.

All other frames are discarded.

Different addressing schemes are employed on different LAN topologies.

Each station's address must be unique on the LAN to which it connects.

Address allocation falls into three categories:
	> Static - Set by the manufacturer.
	> Dynamic - Station sets their address at bootup.
	> Configurable - The network admin sets their address.

There are three possible types of communication possible on a LAN:
	> Unicast - Station-to-Station.
	> Broadcast - Station-to-All-Stations.
	> Multicast - Station-to-Some-Stations.

Unicast communications requires the use of unique MAC addresses.

Broadcast communication requires one address to be recognised by all the stations.

Multicast requires one address to be recognisable to some stations.
