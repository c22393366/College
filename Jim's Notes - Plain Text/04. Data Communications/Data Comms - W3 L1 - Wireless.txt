Data Communication - Wireless Transmission
---------------------------------------------------------

Wireless transmission is usually through something like radio frequencies.

There are two configurations - omnidirectional, and directional.

Networks using EM radio waves are called RF, radio frequency networks.

One method of this transmission is with terrestrial microwaves.

Some of the characteristics of the above are:
	> Microwaves travel at higher frequency than RF (2 - 40 GHz).
	> This allows for larger bandwidth, higher data rate.
	> Waves are focused into a narrow beam by a parabolic dish, and recieved similarly.
	> Line of sight is required, prone to interference from rainfall and other dishes.

These are back-to-back installations used on long hall links.

Very common with mobile networks, e.g. the 3 network.

Satellite microwaves, or just satellites, can link two or more ground stations, i.e. they
act like a relay.

Satellites use two different frequency bands to communicate - uplinks and downlinks,
different frequencies allow full duplex comms.

GEO satellites, or geostrationary earth orbit satellites, remain stationary over a point
on the Earth.

LEO, or low earth orbit satellites, move rapidly over the sky.

The range of these is usually 1 - 10 GHz, and they are used for television and phone
transmission.

One example is the Iridium satellite network, and another is Musk's Starlink.

The environmental effect of this is quite poor, as space junk could hamper future space
travel and block our view of the sky.

We need to know about the limitations and uses of electrical cables and their types.

We also need to know about radio frequencies, the fact they're used for wifi
