Data Communications - Classless Addressing
-----------------------------------------------

THe newer approach for addressing, classless addressing, splits prefix and suffix differently.

Your network number is given different amounts of bits, and your host number is given the
rest, to make up your 32 bit address.

This eliminates a lot of the waste caused by classful addressing, wherein many more
addresses could be allocated to one network than there were hosts to give them to.

An address mask can tell us how many bits are allocated to host number vs network number.

For example, 255.0.0.0 means you have 24 bits for host numbers, and 8 for network, while
255.255.255.0 means 24 bits for the network and 8 for hosts.
