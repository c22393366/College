Data Communications - Analogue Encoding
-------------------------------------------------

When we encode an analogue signal into digital data, we use a technique called sampling.

We take as many sampes of the signal as the highest frequency harmonic, and we give each
of these samples an 8 bit value.

This is called quantisation.
