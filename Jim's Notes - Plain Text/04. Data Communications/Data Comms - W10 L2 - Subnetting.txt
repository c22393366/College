Data Communications - Subnetting
----------------------------------------

When assigning subnets, the number of addresses given to the customer depend on how many
bits are assigned to the host portion.

This means the number of addresses increases in binary, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 etc.

Some IP addresses are considered special addresses, and cannot be sold.

These include the following:

> Directed Broadcast Address - This is defined for each physical network. A suffix of all 1
bits is added to the network prefix. It is a way to communicate with all machines on a
network.

> Limited Broadcast Address - Here an address consisting of all 1 bits will allow a
broadcast on a single wire.

> This Computer Address - An IP address consisting of all zeroes refers to this computer.
THis is used by hosts at boot-up to obtain its IP address.

> Loopback Address - This has a network prefix 127/8; The host suffix is irrelevant. It
facilitates the routing of packets back to the source, i.e. it is the local host address.



Subnetting Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have address block 17.12.30.0/26, and musr divide it into three seperate network,
with 32, 16, and 16 addresses.

First, we must get the subnet masks for each subnet.
	- 32 addresses requires a mask of 27.
	- 16 addresses requires a mask of 28.

For an uneven split like this, we start with the highest size network, and give them
the first addresses.

This is called VLSM, or variable length subnet masks.
