Data Communications - Transmission Media
-------------------------------------------------

The transmission medium is the path along which a signal travels.

The type of medium depends on the kind of signal being transmitted and can affect the
reliability of commuications.

Conventional networks use copper wire - low resistance, but prone to interference.

This interference is minimised by using twisted pair wiring and co-axial cable.

Different cables will have different amounts of twists per centimeter, but more twists
means a more expensive cable.

Twister pair cables are comprised of 2 insulated copper wires twisted together. These
twists help to reduce crosstalk.

Typically many pairs are bundled into a protective sheath.

Many types: Cat3 = 16Mhz, Cat5 = 100Mhz, Cat6 = 250Mhz.

Applications include use in office buildings for phone and computer connectivity, and
in residential telephone networks.

Coaxial cable is comprised of a central copper conductor and a hollow outer cylindrical
conductor, as well as a surrounding sheath to hold the conductors in place.

It has a bandwidth of 1Ghz.

Applications include use in cable TV, long distance telephone, and computer connectivity (LAN).

Optical Fibre has a thin, flexible, transparent glass fibre core, surrounded by glass or
plastic cladding with a lower refractive index.

The outer sheath provides it with rigidity and protection.

Signals are sent in the form of light through the inner glass core.

Several fibres may be bound in a single jacket, and two types of light source can be used:
	> LED - Low cost.
	> Injection Laser Diode - Higher data rates and distances.

Applications include use in long distance telephone, metropolitan trunks, and LANs.

Optical Fibre cables offer the following advantages over coaxial:
	> Electromagnetic isolation.
	> Lower attenuation, greater repeater spacing.
	> Greater data capacity.
	> Requires only a single core for a complete circuit.
