Data Communications - Revision
-----------------------------------------

Data Link Control is a more effective way to manage the communication of data.

We assume all transmissions are in the form of a frame.

We store and process incoming frames to ensure they are not corrupted, and are the expected
frame. For this we use a memory buffer.

Frame Synchronisation - Frames must be recognisable to the reciever.

Flow Control - The sender must not overload the reciever.

Error Control - Errors should be detectable by the reciever.

Addressing - For a multi-point configuration, each station should be uniquely idenfitiable.

Control and Data, Same Link - Everything the reciever needs should be in the same frame.

Link Management - Procedures for establishing and relenquishing link should be followed.

In error control, there are three different techniques, all some form of Automatic Repeat
Request.

Stop and Wait ARQ is based on Stop and Wait flow control.

Go Back N and Selective Reject are both based on Sliding Window flow control.

Frame numbering starts at 0 and usually works on modulo 8 numbering.

With Go Back N, when the reciever sends a REJ reject message to the transmitter, the
transmitter has to send back all frames starting at the one specified in the message.

With Selective Reject, the transmitter need only send back the specified frame in an SREJ.
