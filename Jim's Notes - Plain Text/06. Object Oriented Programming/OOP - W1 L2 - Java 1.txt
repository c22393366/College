OOP - Java 1
---------------------------
Inline if statements can be used to quickly compare values.

For example:

	return (value1 || !value2) ? true:false;

If trying to return for boolean values, we can do it like this:

	return (value1 || !value2);

Brian says "the best line of code you ever wrote was the one you didn't have to write".
