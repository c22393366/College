OOP - Java 2
-------------------------
Java is different from other programming languages as it was one of the first object
oriented languages.

Everything in Java is a class. It is impossible to create just a main with no classes.

Methods are what a class does.

Fields are what a class is.

Some things in classes are private, which means they are inaccessible to anything outside
the class.

These normally have a method that goes with them to allow limited access.

Public items are accessible from anywhere.

A constructor is a method called when an object is created in a class, to give values to the
fields within it.

Algol is an incredibly old programming language, and a predecessor to many others.

The rise of OOP and the rise of GUI usage came around the same time, as OOP was much more
effective for a GUI than procedural languages.

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is a book released in 1994,
written by 4 authors often referred to as the Gang of Four.

A singleton is a class of which only one instance can ever be created - the main class is a
singleton.

Java is run in the Java Virtual Machine.

When a Java program is run, the files composing it are compiled together into a .jar file.

Java was made for certain types of cross platform programming.

When two object are created, A and B, and we say B = A, the pointer to the object B in
memory now no longer points to B, it points to A.

As a result, when we change the object in A, the same changes will be reflected by B.

The object originally pointed to by B will be freed by the garbage collector, which is a low
priority thread that will run when the program isn't too busy.
